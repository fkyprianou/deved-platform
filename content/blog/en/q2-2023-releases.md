Our Video API team has rolled out a new feature called Secure Callbacks, currently in public beta and anticipated for a full launch. Michael explains how the feature validates webhook callback requests from Vonage and ensures their payload hasn't been tampered with. It's a big win for app security and also a plus for compliance-heavy industries.

After an awesome Beta ride, the Vonage Video API MacOS SDK is now officially making its mark with its first-ever stable release. Now, you can flexibly use the MacOS SDK in production, and expect the same maintenance and frequent updates as our other SDKs (JavaScript, Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux). Whether you're just starting out or eager to dive straight into the code, we've got you covered. Our official documentation and MacOS SDK sample repo are filled with all the details and sample apps to kick-start your journey with the SDK.

## [New Vonage Client SDKs for Android and iOS](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/introducing-the-new-vonage-client-sdk-for-android-and-ios)

We're revving things up in Q2 with the grand unveiling of the newly renamed Vonage Client SDK! It's coming in hot with a new major version full of fresh features and fixes. This SDK now uses Kotlin Multiplatform, sharing core functionality between Android and iOS SDKs.

Our developer advocate Abdul covers key concepts, including Session, Invite, Call, and Leg, to familiarize you with its workings. He also guides you through creating a session, making and receiving a call, and push notifications.

## [Vonage Verify V2 Is Now GA for 2FA Integrations](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/vonage-verify-v2-is-now-ga-for-2fa-integrations)

In a significant Q2 milestone, we're delighted to share the General Availability of Version 2 of our Verify API for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). This revised 2FA solution caters to developers, employing Webhooks for asynchronous integrations, which offers more choices and flexibility. With the synchronous flow of V1 behind us, we can now use webhooks with V2, which gives a unique GUID upon initiating a request. We've also bolstered fraud protection with the integration of the Verify Anti-Fraud System to ward off malicious activities.

V2 also expanded the communication channel options, supporting WhatsApp, Email, and Silent Authentication, alongside existing SMS and Voice Text to Speech (TTS). Developers now have complete control over the structure of their request workflow. Lastly, the enhanced usage of HTTP response codes offers better protocol compliance. Try Verify V2 now and experience a more intuitive, secure, and flexible 2FA integration!

5.  [Part 5 - Using Vonage In-App Messaging for Notifications](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/using-vonage-apis-with-mongodb-atlas-part-5)

In this blog series, Chris Tankersley demonstrates how MongoDB Atlas and Vonage APIs can be seamlessly integrated to build sophisticated applications. MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based database service, alleviates the challenge of managing databases across multiple platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, enabling developers to focus on creating rich user experiences. Its built-in user authentication system adds an extra layer of security, ensuring the safety of user credentials.

On the other hand, Vonage APIs, used in conjunction with MongoDB Atlas, allow developers to establish secure, multifaceted communication with users. The Vonage Verify API, when tied with MongoDB's database, presents an added security measure via two-factor authentication. Further, the Messages API enhances customer engagement by enabling multi-channel communication including SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Viber. When a situation requires direct customer interaction, the Vonage Meetings API can be employed to quickly establish video chats. With the help of MongoDB Atlas and the In-App Messaging API, the application can send real-time notifications to authenticated users. Through the example of a restaurant demo application, Chris shows the practical usage and combined strength of MongoDB Atlas and Vonage APIs.
