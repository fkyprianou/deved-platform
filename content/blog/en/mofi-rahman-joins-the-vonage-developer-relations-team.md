Hi there, I am Mofi and I am super excited to be joining the Developer Relations Team at Vonage as a Senior Developer Advocate. I will be focusing on Client SDKs for the Video API. 

I have been a developer advocate for about 3 years. The thing I like most about developer advocacy is the ability to break down complex problems and make them easy to understand. I love to talk to other developers to teach and to learn from. 

My developer journey started in high school with our robotics team. Which lead me to major in computer engineering. I initially wanted to do hardware and electronics related work. But then I took some CS courses and started to learn to program. To be honest, my first few courses were not the most promising, and I was struggling. I almost was thinking of switching out of computer engineering to electrical engineering. But I somehow managed to survive that semester and, over the summer, I spent some time just playing with coding... And it clicked! The moment my understanding went from 0 to 1 was a high I still chase every day. In many ways, that is a feeling I try to replicate when I help others to get to their 0 to 1.

Now, after several years working as a developer advocate, I got to travel all over the country (and abroad), got to speak at many conferences, mentored at hackathons, taught workshops for O’Reilly, worked with clients to help with solutions, and I could not be happier. This role allows me to connect with people, learn new things and teach others, and for that, I am grateful.

My programming language of choice these days is Go and JS. I am pretty involved with the Go community in NY and am one of the organizers of the Golang NYC meetup. I am a strong believer in open source and contributed to a few projects over the years.

I love collecting tech stickers. I have about a box full of them. In my spare time, I enjoy board games. My birthday wishlist is just a giant list of board games, making it very easy for my friends to get me gifts. 

I am thrilled to be a part of this community! I can’t wait to work with you all, and once things start opening back up again, maybe see your faces at conferences.
