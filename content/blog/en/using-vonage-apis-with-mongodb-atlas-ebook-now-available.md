Today, we are pleased to introduce a free eBook, Using Vonage Communications APIs With MongoDB Atlas. [Chris Tankersley](https://twitter.com/dragonmantank) wrote the book to walk you through building an application that utilizes MongoDB Atlas and a suite of Vonage Communications APIs. Chris will walk you through building a sample application that will be a simple restaurant website and an associated backend.

In this Ebook, we will show:

* How to integrate Vonage Verify API with a user login

* How to use Vonage Meetings API for issue resolution

We will also help developers set up:

* User Authentication with MongoDB Users

While we will be breaking down how this works throughout this material, glance at the source code for the application  on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vonage-Community/sample-mongodb-vonage-integration-restaurant-demo).
