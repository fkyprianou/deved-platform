Today, we are pleased to introduce a free eBook titled, Using Vonage Communications APIs With MongoDB Atlas. The book was written by Chris Tankerskey to walk you through building an application that utilizes MongoDB Atlas and a suite of Vonage Communications APIs. 

The demo application will take the form of a simple restaurant website and an associated backend.

We will show:

* How to integrate Vonage Verify API with a user login
* How to use Vonage Messages API to send an order confirmation
* How to use Vonage Meetings API for issue resolution

We will also help developers set up:

* A MongoDB Atlas cluster and associated App Service
* Having a front-end app talk back to MongoDB Atlas via Realm
* User Authentication with MongoDB Users

While we will be breaking down how all of this works over time, feel free to take a quick glance at the source code for the application on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vonage-Community/sample-mongodb-vonage-integration-restaurant-demo).
