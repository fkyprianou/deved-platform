In this tutorial, we're going to learn how to make outgoing text-to-speech phone calls using Go and the [Voice API](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/overview). This tutorial will require creating a Vonage application that has voice capabilities.

You can find the code shown in this tutorial on the [Go code snippets repository](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-go-code-snippets/blob/master/voice/make-an-outbound-call-ncco.go).

## Prerequisites

* A phone number
* [A Vonage Account](http://developer.nexmo.com/ed?c=blog_text&ct=2020-11-25-make-text-to-speech-call-with-go)
* [Go installed locally](https://golang.org/)
* [Ngrok](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr)

## Configure Your Vonage Account

Create an application under "Your Applications" in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/). Give your new application a name and then select "Generate public and private key", this downloads the private.key file for you which you should then move the file to be alongside the code you are about to create.

Under Capabilities, toggle on Voice.

> **\*Note:** For this tutorial you don't need to set up webhooks to handle the two fields required: "Event" and "Answer". However, as you are required to enter these fields form, you're welcome to put a URL such as: "http://example.com/event" and "http://example.com/answer". If you wish to handle these yourself, you'll need to build two webhooks in your application to receive the requests, and then expose your webhooks to the Internet. My suggestion for this would be to use ngrok, which we have an excellent tutorial for here: [https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr).

The page that now loads will display your Application ID. Make a note of this ID!

You've now purchased a Vonage virtual number and created a Vonage Application.

## Set up the Code

It's now time to write your code to make this text to speech voice call. In your project directory (where you also saved your `private.key` file, create a new file called `make-an-outbound-call-ncco.go` and enter the following code:

> **Note:** be sure to update the `PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` to be the path to your private key file (including the private key file name), your `APPLICATION_ID` with the application Id you noted down earlier in the tutorial, update the `VONAGE_NUMBER` to your recently purchased Vonage virtual number. Finally, update `TO_NUMBER` with your number that you expect to receive the call.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"

    "github.com/vonage/vonage-go-sdk"
    "github.com/vonage/vonage-go-sdk/ncco"
)

func main() {
    privateKey, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE)
    auth, _ := vonage.CreateAuthFromAppPrivateKey(APPLICATION_ID, privateKey)
    client := vonage.NewVoiceClient(auth)

    from := vonage.CallFrom{Type: "phone", Number: VONAGE_NUMBER}
    to := vonage.CallTo{Type: "phone", Number: TO_NUMBER}

    MyNcco := ncco.Ncco{}
    talk := ncco.TalkAction{Text: "This is a text to speech call from Vonage"}
    MyNcco.AddAction(talk)

    result, _, _ := client.CreateCall(vonage.CreateCallOpts{From: from, To: to, Ncco: MyNcco})

    fmt.Println(result.Uuid + " call ID started")
}
```

In the above code, within the `main()` function first retrieves the value of your private key file (Which should be called `private.key`), it then creates an auth object using your Application id and your `private.key`. Following this, you're creating a new Voice Client object, creating objects for your "from" and "to" phone numbers with the type "phone".

You're then creating an `Ncco` object with the `TalkAction` of "This is a text to speech call from Vonage", which you then add to the `MyNcco` object. Finally, a call request gets made to the `voice API` containing the `from`, `to` and `Ncco` objects.

If you have initiated the call successfully, then you will see the call Uuid output to your Terminal.

## Time to Test

In your Terminal window, make sure you've navigated to the project directory containing your `make-an-outbound-call-ncco.go` file, and run the following command to make your phone call:

```bash
go run make-an-outbound-call-ncco.go
```

If successful, you should see something similar to the output below in your Terminal:

```bash
0a345567-913d-4e49-af04-cec9bfbcbfcd call ID started
```

Check your phone for the incoming call, answer it and hear the wonderful words of "This is a text to speech call from Vonage".

You've now written a Go application that uses Vonage Voice API to make a Text-to-speech outbound voice call!
