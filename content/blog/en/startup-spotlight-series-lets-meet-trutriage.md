Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, it was estimated that in April 2020 overall telehealth utilization for office visits and outpatient care was 78 times higher than in February 2020.

As the world is slowly transitioning towards normalcy, telehealth is expected to stay past the pandemic as a result of increasing willingness from both consumers and providers to utilise telehealth, but also changes in regulation which have enabled the uptake of these digital services. The COVID-19 restrictions have enabled healthcare providers to re-invent archaic care models, and with the growth of telehealth past the pandemic, healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability are going to improve as a result.

TruTriage has been a pioneer in the telehealth space since 2019, with a first of its kind video-enabled 911 nurse triage solution enabling organizations to deliver nurse triage for low acuity 911 callers regardless of their resource capability. In this week's Startup Spotlight series, we caught up with Brad Lieberman, COO of TruTriage and got insights into the future of telehealth. Enjoy!

## The startup at a glance

**Startup Name**: [TruTriage](https://www.trutriage.com/)

**Industry**: Telehealth

**Location**: Westminster Maryland

**Date founded**: May 2019

**Number of employees**: 4

**LinkedIn**: <https://www.linkedin.com/company/trutriage>

**Vonage API used**: Voice and SMS 

## In one sentence, what does TruTriage do?

We are giving non-emergency 911 callers access to the appropriate healthcare resources so they receive the right care at the right time at the right price.

## What is the problem you are solving? Was this the initial problem or did you pivot? 

We are solving the overuse of emergency healthcare resources for non-emergency conditions. This was the original problem that we have set out to solve.

## What differentiates TruTriage from your competitors? Is there a secret sauce? 

Our secret sauce is our background technology which connects directly into the 911 call center. We have built a platform that allows us to take the 911 call data and then leverage our nurse triage services into the 911 call workflow. This technology was purpose built for the delivery of 911 nurse triage. Additionally, we are the only company that focuses on serving small and middle market communities. 

## VC, Angel, Bootstrap or Other?

We bootstrapped and then we received a VC Seed Round from the Conscious Venture Fund in Baltimore Maryland.

## What’s the biggest challenge you faced and how did you overcome it?

Building out our software platform from scratch and working with industry experts to customize our solution for the Emergency Medical Community. We had to meet with many potential customers and work with them to fill a niche that had not previously been filled.

## The biggest mistake TruTriage has made so far and what did you learn from it?

Thinking that we could change things overnight. We learned that progress takes time and change takes time, but that if you are persistent and have a solid plan/product customers will trust you.

## You can choose one to be on your board: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Who do you choose and why? 

We would choose Elon Musk because he has built so many companies in varying industries and has always focused on technologies that not only can generate profits but that help improve society and the world around us.

## What progress have you made since launching? 

We have built out our software platform and have communities that are interested and currently testing. We plan to have paying customers by the end of the quarter.

## What’s next for TruTriage? Where do you want to be in 3 years?

We want to be a change in the healthcare industry and help provide resources all over the country to help benefit lower socioeconomic and at risk communities that are underserved and overcharged by the emergency medical care system.
