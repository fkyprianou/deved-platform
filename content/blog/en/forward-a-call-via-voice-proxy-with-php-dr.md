Today's post shows you how to proxy a voice call so that it appears to come from another number.

This is not as dubious as it sounds: there are many compelling business reasons why you might want to hide a caller's real number from other parties in the call.

A classic example is an online taxi service. To make the booking experience as smooth as possible, you want your customer and driver to be able to communicate with each other. But you don't want the driver to know the customer's real number (because you want to protect that customer's privacy) and, conversely, you don't want your customer to know your driver's number and book rides directly without using your service.

Luckily, this is really easy to do in PHP with the Nexmo Voice API, so let's get to it! The [complete source code](https://github.com/nexmo-community/php-voice-proxy) is available on Github.

## Install Dependencies


To work with inbound calls using Nexmo's Voice API, you must provide [webhooks](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/webhooks) so that Nexmo can send data to your application.

We'll use `slim` to code these webhooks: a lightweight web framework for PHP. You can find out more about `slim` [here](http://www.slimframework.com/).

Install `slim` using `composer`:

```
composer require slim/slim:^3.8
```

## Define the Webhook Endpoints

Create a file called `index.php` that contains the following code:

```php
<?php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new \Slim\App;
$app->get('/webhooks/answer', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
  /* Code to process the inbound call */
});

$app->post('/webhooks/events', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
  /* Code that executes when an event is received */
});

$app->run();
```

This code creates a new `slim` application and defines two routes. These routes correspond to the following webhook endpoints:

* `/webhooks/answer`: Nexmo's APIs make a `GET` request to this endpoint when you receive an inbound call on your virtual number.
* `/webhooks/events`: Nexmo's APIs make a `POST` request to this endpoint every time a significant even occurs (such as call `ringing`, being `answered` and `completed`) to update your application on the status of the call.

## Log Call Events

Let's deal with the `/webhooks/events` endpoint first. Every time we are notified about an event we want to log it. This will help you debug any issues later on.

This example uses PHP's built-in web development server and the `error_log()` function to output data to a log file (`event.log`).

Create a `php.ini` file in the root of your application which includes the following settings:

```
error_log = ./event.log
log_errors = on
date.timezone = UTC
```

Then, update the `/webhooks/events` handler to log incoming event data:

```php
$app->post('/webhooks/events', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    error_log($request->getBody());
});
```

## Handle Inbound Calls

When you receive an inbound call, Nexmo's API makes a `GET` request to your `/webhooks/answer` endpoint and expects the response to contain instructions on how to process the call.

You provide these instructions in the form of a Nexmo Call Control Object (NCCO) in JSON format. The NCCO defines the various "actions" that the call needs to take, such as `input` to collect any digits the user might press on their telephone keypad or `stream` to play audio into the call. You can find the full list of actions in the [NCCO Reference](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference).

Before we concern ourselves with the proxy logic, let's first ensure that we can receive an inbound call on our Nexmo number.

Test your application with a `talk` action that uses TTS (text-to-speech) to read a message to your caller. Define and return the following NCCO in your `/webhooks/answer` route handler:

```php
$app->get('/webhooks/answer', function (Request $request, Response $response) {

    $ncco = [
        [
            'action' => 'talk',
            'text' => 'Thank you for calling. Everything appears to be working properly',
        ],
    ];
    return $response->withJson($ncco);
});
```

## Make Your Webhooks Accessible

For Nexmo's APIs to make requests to your webhook endpoints they must to be accessible over the Internet.

A great tool for exposing your local development environment to the public Internet is `ngrok`. Our [tutorial](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/) shows you how to install and use it.

Launch `ngrok` using the following command:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

Make a note of the public URLs that `ngrok` created for you. These will be similar to (but different from) the following:

```
http://066d53c9.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000
https://066d53c9.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000
```

On their free plan, every time you restart `ngrok` the URLs change and you will have to update your Voice API application configuration. So leave it running for the duration of this tutorial. 

## Purchase a Number

You need a Nexmo virtual number to receive phone calls. If you don't already have a Nexmo number you can purchase one easily using the [Nexmo CLI](https://developer.nexmo.com/tools).

You can install the Nexmo CLI using the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), `npm`:

```
npm install -g nexmo-cli
```

Then, configure the Nexmo CLI with your API key and secret from the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com):

```
nexmo setup YOUR_API_KEY YOUR_API_SECRET
```

To see what numbers are available, use `nexmo number:search`, passing it your two-character country code. For example, `GB` for Great Britain or `US` for the USA. You want to ensure that the number you purchase is able to receive voice calls:

```
nexmo number:search COUNTRY_CODE --voice
```

Choose a number from the list and buy it using the following command:

```
nexmo number:buy <NUMBER>
```

You will be prompted to confirm your purchase. Make a note of the number that you bought.

## Create a Nexmo Voice API Application

You now need to create a Nexmo Voice API Application. An application in this context is not the same as the application you have just written the code for. Instead, it is a container for the configuration and security information you need to use the Voice API.

You'll use the Nexmo CLI again for this. You need to specify the following information:

* A name for your application
* The public URL to your `/webhooks/answer` endpoint (e.g. `https://066d53c9.ngrok.io/webhooks/answer`)
* The public URL to your `/webhooks/events` endpoint (e.g. `https://066d53c9.ngrok.io/webhooks/events`)
* The name and location of the file that will contain your security credentials

In the same directory as your PHP application, enter the following command, supplying the appropriate URLs for your webhook endpoints:

```
nexmo app:create “My Voice Proxy” ANSWER_URL EVENT_URL --keyfile private.key
```

This configures a Voice API application with your webhooks and downloads your security credentials in a file called `private.key`. The Voice Application is identified by a unique application ID: make a note of this as you will need it in the next step.

## Link the Application to Your Nexmo Number

Next, you need to link your Voice API application to your Nexmo number.

Execute the following command, replacing `APPLICATION_ID` with the one generated by the `nexmo app:create` command that you executed in the preceding step:

```
nexmo link:app NEXMO_NUMBER APPLICATION_ID
```

Verify that the number and application are linked by executing the `nexmo app:list` command. You can also see this information in the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).

```
nexmo app:list 
```

## Call Your Nexmo Virtual Number

With `ngrok` running on port 3000 in one terminal window, launch your PHP application on the same port in another:

```
php -S localhost:3000 -c php.ini
```

Call your Nexmo number. If everything is working OK, you should hear the message you defined in your NCCO and then the call terminates.

Check the `event.log` and note which events were recorded during the call.

## Implement the Proxy Logic

To create a voice proxy we can connect the inbound call to our target recipient's number and use our Nexmo virtual number to hide the inbound caller's real number.

Create two string constants to store these numbers:

- `FROM_NUMBER`: Your Nexmo virtual number
- `TO_NUMBER`: A landline or mobile number you can use for testing. This should be different from the number you will use to make the initial call.

```php
define(FROM_NUMBER, /* Your Nexmo number */);
define(TO_NUMBER, /* Your target number */;
```

Both numbers should include the country code and omit any leading zeroes. For example, in the UK the country code is `44`. So if my mobile number is `07700 900004`, the correct format is `447700900004`.

Use the NCCO `connect` action to connect the inbound caller to the recipient. Replace the current NCCO in your `/webhooks/answer` endpoint with the following:

```php
    $ncco = [
        [
            'action' => 'connect',
            'from' => FROM_NUMBER,
            'endpoint' => [
                [
                    'type' => 'phone',
                    'number' => TO_NUMBER,
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ];
```

## Test the Voice Proxy

Ensure that `ngrok` is still running in one terminal window and re-launch your PHP application in another:

```
php -S localhost:3000 -c php.ini
```

Call your Nexmo virtual number. When the call is answered it should immediately ring your second number. That call should originate from your Nexmo number rather than the number you used to place the call.

That's it! You have now implemented a simple voice proxy that hides a caller's real number.
