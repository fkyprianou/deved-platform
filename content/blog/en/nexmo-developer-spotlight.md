Technical writers and bloggers, influencers and innovators! Nexmo is opening up this blog to our community with our new **Developer Spotlight** guest blogging program, and we need your submissions. Our goal is to provide a destination for developers in search of high-quality tutorials and interesting development stories, and we know the best resource for stories like these is you, the Nexmo community and friends. 

We have some really great posts from developers in the community lined up for our official launch, coming soon! Keep your eyes peeled for that. In the meantime, throw your hat into the ring by submitting your own idea. What have you built lately? We want to hear your voice and put the **Spotlight** on you!

## What We’re Looking For

We’re interested in both technical tutorials and general pieces on programming. All successful submissions will be:

*   **Original**. Literally, we want original work (nothing that has been published elsewhere). And more figuratively, we want to see original thought and interesting points of view we can’t find anywhere else.
*   **Well-written**. Our standards are high, and we want everything published on our blog to meet those standards. That said, you don’t have to be a professional writer to submit! If the post is original, helpful, and interesting, our editorial team is happy to work with you to get it publication-ready.

### Technical Tutorials

Tutorials with code, usually involving Nexmo’s suite of products in some way. Get technical! Our readers are developers like you who want to build cool stuff, so if you have the dirt on how to do that, share! Successful submissions will be:

*   **Technical**. Don’t shy away from code-heavy posts. We’re looking for true, deep-dive tutorials with actionable examples and usable code.
*   **Helpful**. Your tutorial should aim to teach and guide other developers through your project with easy-to-follow steps, useful code snippets, and clear direction.
*   **Interesting**. We’re looking for cool stuff.
*   **Tested**. Test your tutorial in full on a fresh server before submitting; make sure it works!

### Leadership in Programming

In addition to technical tutorials, we are open to other posts of general interest to our developer audience. If it’s interesting to you as a Nexmo user, it will probably be interesting to others. Successful submissions will be:

*   **Passionate**. We’re looking for developers who love what they do and can’t wait to share their stories with the larger community.
*   **Authoritative**. You should know what you’re talking about; share your relevant credentials, experience, and qualifications in your introductory email.

## Examples

These are examples of the type of post we’re looking for:

*   [Build a Babel Fish with Nexmo, and the Microsoft Translator Speech API](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/03/14/speech-voice-translation-microsoft-dr/)
*   [Making a Text-to-Speech Phone Call with Django](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/08/14/text-to-speech-phone-call-with-django-dr/)
*   [Getting Out of a Bad Date (with Fitbit and Nexmo)](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/03/02/getting-bad-date-fitbit-nexmo-dr/)

## How to Submit

Please send an email to [editor@nexmo.com](mailto:editor@nexmo.com):

*   Introduce yourself in the email body and share enough about your background to give us a picture of who you are and why you’d like to write for us.
*   Include a summary of the post you’d like to write for us. It doesn’t have to be long, but should give a clear picture of your idea and why it’s valuable to our audience.
*   Include a link to a sample of your written work (a blog post, article, or similar).
*   Include the phrase "**Developer Spotlight Submission"** in the subject line of your email.

## The Process

When we receive your submission, our editorial team will evaluate it to see if it’s a good fit for the Nexmo blog. Submission is not a guarantee that your work will be published; we reserve the right to decline submissions that aren’t right for our platform. But we want to publish your work and will make a good faith effort to work with each and every community member who takes the time to submit. Our goal is simple: we want to see what you’re doing with Nexmo’s products, and we want to help you share your story with the community. 

We’ll be in touch to let you know if we want to publish your post and share next steps.

## What’s in it for You?

We pay our **Spotlight** contributors $400 per post. Your tutorial will be published on our blog, and may also be shared in our newsletter or showcased as part of our “Tutorial Tuesday” weekly feature. We make every effort to amplify the reach of each and every blog post on our site, and yours will be no exception; you’ll have the Nexmo marketing and social media teams behind you getting the word out about your work, because your success is our success.
