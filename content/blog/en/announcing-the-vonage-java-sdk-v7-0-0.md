## Introduction
Since joining Vonage, I have been focusing on improving the [core Java SDK](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-java-sdk) by paying down some technical debt and ensuring it is up to date with the latest [API specifications](https://developer.vonage.com/api). In this post, I'll explain some of the prominent changes to the SDK and what's on the horizon. Hopefully I can also convince you to upgrade to the latest version ðŸ™‚. You can also check out the [release notes for each version on GitHub](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-java-sdk/releases).
