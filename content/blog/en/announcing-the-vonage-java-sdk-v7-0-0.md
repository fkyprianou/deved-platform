## Introduction
Since joining Vonage, I have been focusing on improving the [core Java SDK](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-java-sdk) by paying down some technical debt and ensuring it is up to date with the latest [API specifications](https://developer.vonage.com/api). In this post, I'll explain some of the prominent changes to the SDK and what's on the horizon. Hopefully I can also convince you to upgrade to the latest version ðŸ™‚. You can also check out the [release notes for each version on GitHub](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-java-sdk/releases).

## Security
If I could only give you one reason to upgrade, it would be security. Versions [prior to 6.4.2 are susceptible to over 50 CVE security vulnerabilities](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.vonage/client) due to outdated dependencies (mainly Jackson, which is what we use for JSON serialisation).

Prior to v7.0.0, the SDK depended on a small in-house library for working with JWTs. This library [hadn't been updated for a few years and was still under the Nexmo brand](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.nexmo/jwt). It has now moved to the Vonage org on GitHub(https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-jwt-jdk) and [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.vonage/jwt), receiving a rebrand for consistency along with dependency updates for security.
