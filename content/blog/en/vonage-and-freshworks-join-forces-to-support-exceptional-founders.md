_Vonage for Startups_ is thrilled to announce our new partnership with _Freshworks for Startups_ to empower startups across the globe. Freshworks provides innovative customer engagement software for businesses of all sizes, making it easy for teams to acquire, close, and keep their customers for life.

Freshworks has always been a friend of startups. They have built this friendship over the course of ten years, becoming one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in the world. Freshworks is now one of the fastest-growing unicorns backed by Google Capital, Accel, Sequoia and  Tiger Global, valued at over $3.5Bn.

Freshworks launched their startup program last year to get startups accustomed to the Freshworks ecosystem and help them scale by sharing learnings from across the board.

We’re excited to combine our efforts with the Freshworks team to support startups across both our communities and enable them to build outstanding customer experiences.

Both of our programs were born out of the need to pay it forward to the founder community, with whom we share the same roots.

## So what’s in it for our startups?

When joining the _Vonage for Startups_ program, startups get a credit package for our Communications APIs, hands-on support from product specialists, exclusive co-promotion opportunities, and all the tools they need to start building excellent customer experiences.  
Now the _Freshworks for Startups_ community can enjoy these perks too!

In addition, with the support from our friends at _Freshworks for Startups_, Founders on our program can also benefit from access to credit, market access and more on the following Freshworks products:

* **Freshworks CRM**: Get actionable insights with visual reports, the power of artificial intelligence, and make better decisions with the best CRM for your business.

* **Freshdesk**: Streamline customer conversations and automate repetitive tasks with our customer support software.

* **Freshteam**: Use Application Tracking System (ATS) to source and hire great talent faster, using our HR management software.

* **Freshservice**: Get in-depth visibility of your IT Assets using our ITIL aligned IT Service Management Software.

Join our vibrant communities of VCs, Investors, industry leaders, and Startup Founders to gain access to customers, mentorship, learning opportunities, and more.

We hope to support founders from across the globe and provide them with the right tools to grow their business.
