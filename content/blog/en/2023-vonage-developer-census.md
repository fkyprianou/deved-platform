The Vonage DevRel team would like to invite all our users to take part in our 2023 Developer Census. Our job is to work directly with developers to help make our products better, so we want to give our entire community a chance to give us some feedback. We take all feedback seriously, and when possible help push this back to our product teams to make our products better.

We also want to make sure that what we offer is accessible and useful as possible. All this information will help us make decisions in 2023 to make working with Vonage APIs even easier.

### Goals

* We want to understand our communities main priorities and needs.
* We want to understand our strengths and weaknesses better.
* We want to categorize our users to know how to best cater to different development communities.

### What kind of questions are we asking?

First and foremost, we want to collect feedback on what you think we are doing well, where we are doing poorly, and where we can improve. This includes some basic demographic information about you, the developer, and what products you use. We will also ask your opinions about Vonage, tooling, and development strategies.

### How will we use this information?

Most of the questions that we ask are optional, so you are free to answer as much of the survey as you would like. These results will only be available to the Vonage Developer Relations team and will not be used for sales purposes. Only the final summarized results will be shared with wider audiences. All information provided in any form will be governed by our [Vonage Privacy Policy](https://www.vonage.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

Information will be anonymized, aggregated, and summarized into the final results. We will then publish these summarized results as well as any additional information we have on said results on <https://developer.vonage.com/blog>.

### Where can I fill out the census?
