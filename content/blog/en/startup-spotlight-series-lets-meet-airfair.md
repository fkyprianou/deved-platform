Throughout the pandemic, digital connectivity has played an increasingly important role in how we stay connected, which, for many, has increased the importance of online communities and events. 



The global virtual events market size was valued by Grand View Research at $77.98 billion in 2019 and is now expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.2% from 2020 to 2027. While recent research by the GovLab indicated that 3 out of 4 people believe that the most important community they're a part of operates online.



As a result of the booming online community and events industry, more and more platforms are being introduced to the market. At the moment there are tools available for small events, for large events, for roadshows and on the other side there are tools that allow you to engage with your community. What if you could create and run online experiences, from events to daily community interactions, in one unified platform?



That’s the ambitious target of the team at [Airfair](https://www.airfair.io/). The team is creating an all in one engagement platform aiming to not only invite your audience to join for events, but stay for the community, by offering them a personalized, social experience where they can interact with each other, watch content from past events and join upcoming ones, all year round.



This week we caught up with Salim Semaoune, the Co-Founder and CTO of Airfair to find out more about how they are planning to change the face of online experiences forever.

## In one sentence, what does Airfair do?

We provide software to run virtual events and engage your community all year long.

## What is the problem you are solving? Was this the initial problem or did you pivot?

We help event organizers, owners of digital native communities and tech companies to engage their audience all year round through virtual events, webinars and a community space, from a single platform.

## What differentiates Airfair from your competitors? Is there a secret sauce?

All in one engagement platform: with Airfair, our customers can run various formats on a single platform. Most of the solutions that exist are just simple tools to easily go online to do a product demo, a webinar or other formats of live streams.



But when the event is varied, all this content is lost, and your community lives only in your CRM. At Airfair, we want to give a platform where your community members will engage all year long.

## VC, Angel, Bootstrap or Other?

Partech (France) - DN Capital (UK) + several US/UK/EU-based business angels

## What’s the biggest challenge you faced and how did you overcome it?

The biggest challenge that we face right now is that we want to provide an all in one platform so that the organizers don’t have to glue multiple tools that don’t necessarily play well together. It requires us to build tons of features while still keeping the focus on our + alpha feature set.

## The biggest mistake Airfair has made so far and what did you learn from it?

We’ve tried to build too well, and should have released a less clean product and iterate faster with customer feedback

## You can choose one to be on your board: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Who do you choose and why? 

We’d pick Bill Gates, as he was a pioneer of creating a software ecosystem 



## What progress have you made since launching? 

1. Recruited an amazing team
2. Released a product
3. Signed and onboarded first 3 customers

## What’s next for Airfair? Where do you want to be in 3 years?

We want to become the de-facto platform for engaging your audience online.
