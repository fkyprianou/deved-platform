This summer we are excited to have three aspiring DevRel professionals join our team for 10 weeks as part of Vonage’s internship program. During this period they’ll get to work on real life projects, learn from our team as well as colleagues across the company and connect with a bunch of other interns. Let’s find out a bit more about Elena, Rushil and Zoe.


## Where and what are you studying?

Elena: I am studying at Mercyhurst University for a degree in English with a concentration in technical writing. I will be entering my junior year!

Rushil: I’m currently studying Maths and Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania.

Zoe: I am a third-year undergrad student studying Digital Arts and Sciences at the University of Florida


## Where are you based?

Elena: Erie, Pennsylvania, born and raised.

Rushil: I’m currently based in the California Bay Area (although I have moved around a lot, having lived in Nevada and Hawaii as well!).

Zoe: I am located in Blue Ridge, GA but I live in Tampa, FL. I enjoy cooking, traveling, and any outdoor activities.

Tell us about what you will be working on during your internship at Vonage

Elena: I will be working with the APD team to focus on objectives like technical writing, technical skills, project management, and the product development/knowledge within Vonage.

Rushil: I will be working to organize community engagement events and forums where third-party developers can provide feedback and learn more about Vonage’s new products and tech, specifically in regards to Vonage’s APIs. I will also be conducting competitor analysis and partner outreach with potential startup partners.

Zoe: During my internship with Vonage, I will be working on projects using JavaScript and APIs. Similarly, I will be learning about and applying my Web Design, APIs, and Databases knowledge. Above all, I will be creating and reviewing content such as presentations, start samples, and example apps. I will help ensure connectivity within the developer community through social media, streaming, webinars and blog posts.



## What are you looking forward to learning this summer?

Elena: I am really looking forward to just expanding my knowledge overall for the field I want to pursue. I know that documentation software is a huge part of my future career, and just getting to learn from firsthand experience is something I am so excited about.

Rushil: I’m really looking forward to learning from both Product and Engineering teams about how third-party developer feedback is taken into account and acted upon during the product development and update process. Additionally, I’m excited to learn from promising, fast-growing startups and explore partnership possibilities with them.

Zoe: I am excited to support, learn, and become immersed in the world of Vonage through communication and connections during my internship. 



## What are some of your hobbies/ interests?

Elena: I LOVE reading. I try to read as many books as I can, especially during the summer. I also love anything that has to do with music like singing, playing piano, ukulele, and whatever I can put my hands on! Besides that, during the summer I usually just go to the beach and check out coffee shops in my area!

Rushil: In my free time, I love playing basketball, hiking, and writing poetry.

Zoe: I love photography, creating digital art, and playing video games. 

Wishing everyone an amazing intern experience - we can’t wait to see what you build in the next 10 weeks!
