# U﻿sing Vonage Cloud Runtime in Support

A﻿s an API Support Engineer, I am constantly amazed by the ingenuity and innovation of our customers who are pushing technology and our APIs and SDKs to the limits of their capabilities.  Since its early beta, the Support Team have been looking at ways we can leverage the features of the Vonage Cloud Runtime (VCR) platform to help us support these customer innovations.

## What is VCR?

V﻿CR allows you to create, run, debug and deploy components or full applications directly within the Vonage Cloud.  On top of this runs CodeCache.  A library of application templates that can be used to rapidly create and deploy implementations of any Vonage API.  Add to this a fully featured IDE and command line access to your server instance and you have a powerful solution for development.

## H﻿ow does this help the Support Team?

R﻿egardless of the Vonage APIs in use, the support team can create, customise and deploy a fully functional app that emulates a customer configuration or implementation.  We can troubleshoot and debug in real-time within a few short minutes.  This allows us to focus on resolving issues rather than setting up test environments.

## W﻿hat are the benefits?

F﻿aster turnaround for support tickets is an obvious answer.  However, we can also save Workspaces where bugs have been reproduced so that they can be reviewed with Engineering.  Additionally, the solutions can be shared with customers directly.  Being able to share a working solution with customers or a reproduced issue with Engineering is a huge benefit.

N﻿ow, with the public beta of Vonage Cloud Runtime and CodeCache, customers can access this tool themselves to test new APIs or features.
