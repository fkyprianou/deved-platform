## The Nexmo DevRel team is beyond excited to attend Grace Hopper this year!

The annual [Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing](https://ghc.anitab.org/) is just around the corner. October 1-4, attendees will flood the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, FL to listen to keynote speakers, attend informative panels, and network with one another to build relationships and learn from one another. 

With over 20K women in attendance from 81 countries and all walks of life, this truly is the largest gathering of women and gender diverse technologists, and supporters of women in digital, on the planet 🌎

Lauren Lee and Amanda Folson will be attending and they are eager to build a community with attendees and speakers alike.
