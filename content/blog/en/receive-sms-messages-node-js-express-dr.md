> We've built this tutorial using the Vonage SMS API, Node.js, and Express

In the previous article, you set up your Vonage account and learned [how to send SMS messages with Node.js](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2016/10/19/how-to-send-sms-messages-with-node-js-and-express-dr/). In this blog post, you will learn about receiving an inbound SMS by implementing a webhook endpoint in Node.js using [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

**View** **[the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/receive-sms-node)**

## Defining a Webhook Endpoint

To receive an SMS message from Vonage, you need to associate a webhook endpoint (URL) with a virtual number you have rented from Vonage. [Inbound Messages](https://developer.vonage.com/messaging/sms/guides/inbound-sms) to that number are then sent to your webhook endpoint.

While developing the webhook endpoint, it is a pain to keep deploying your work in progress. To make your life easier, let’s use **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)** to expose your webhook endpoint on your local machine as a public URL!

### Using ngrok

First, download ngrok from <https://ngrok.com>. Once installed, run ngrok on terminal:

```bash
$ ngrok http 3000
```

![running ngrok](/content/blog/how-to-receive-sms-messages-with-node-js-and-express/ngrok.png "running ngrok")

Your local server (localhost:3000) now has an ngrok URL like `https://71f03962.ngrok.io` that can be used as your webhook endpoint during development. Also, notice the Web Interface URL—you can inspect, modify, and replay your requests here—more about this later!

### Setting the Webhook Endpoint With Vonage

Sign in to your Vonage account, go to [Settings](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings), and find the **SMS Settings** section.  

Vonage has two different APIs capable of sending and receiving SMS messages. You can only use one at a time because it will change the format of the webhooks you receive. This time, we're going with the `SMS API`, so make sure this is selected.  

Next, fill out the **Inbound SMS webhooks** field using the ngrok URL with a route—let’s call it "inbound". Enter `https://YOUR_NGROK_URL/inbound`, set the **HTTP Method** to `POST` then click on **Save changes**.

Now all your incoming messages will go to the webhook (callback) URL, so let’s write some code with Node.js and Express!

> Note: Above, we're setting the webhook endpoint for SMS at an account level. Alternatively, you can also set up unique webhook endpoints for each virtual number by clicking *Manage* next to one of [your virtual numbers](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/your-numbers) in the Vonage dashboard.

## Writing Webhook Endpoints With Express

Next, you'll handle the `POST` requests with [Express](https://expressjs.com/), so install it.

```shell
$ npm install express
```

Add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file to enable [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) statements.

Create a `.js` file, instantiate Express, and listen at port 3000. Because you have set your ngrok to expose `localhost:3000`, you must stick with the same port.

```javascript
import express from 'express';

const { json, urlencoded } = express;

const app = express();

app.use(json());
app.use(
    urlencoded({
        extended: true
    })
);

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

Next, create an HTTP POST route to handle the requests:

```javascript
app.post('/inbound', (req, res) => {
  handleParams(req.body, res);
});
```

Then define the `handleParams` function:

```javascript
function handleParams(params, res) {
  if (!params.to || !params.msisdn) {
    console.log('This is not a valid inbound SMS message!');
  } else {
    let incomingData = {
      messageId: params.messageId,
      from: params.msisdn,
      text: params.text,
      type: params.type,
      timestamp: params['message-timestamp']
    };
    console.log('Success', incomingData);
  }
  res.status(200).end();
}
```

Run the node code, and try sending some messages from your phone to your virtual number!

When you are tunneling your local app with ngrok, you can also inspect the request at <http://127.0.0.1:4040/> on your browser:

![ngrok inspector](/content/blog/how-to-receive-sms-messages-with-node-js-and-express/ngrok-inspector.png "ngrok inspector")

Voilà, now you can see your SMS message has been sent. Vonage has received the message and passed it on to your Express application via a Webhook!
