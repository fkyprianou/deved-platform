## Introduction

Making phone calls is a necessity for some of us. But every time you put your phone number out there, you're exposing it to *strangers*. The balance between security and convenience is a fine line. What if you could mask your phone number by giving them a different phone number to call?

A voice proxy is a technique that allows you to protect private information between callers by masking each other's phone number behind an intermediary phone number.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to protect both caller and callee phone numbers by creating a voice proxy. When a person calls your Nexmo number the phone call will be routed to your personal phone. The person calling you will only need to know your Nexmo number and, as a bonus, you won't know their phone number either.

## Prerequisites

<sign-up number></sign-up>

You will be using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage your dependencies and run your application. Additionally, you'll need to make sure you have a copy of the JDK installed. I will be using JDK 11 in this tutorial, but anything JDK 8 and higher should work.

Finally, you'll need the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli) installed. You'll use it to purchase a phone number and configure your Nexmo account to point at your new application.

## Forward a Phone Call via Voice Proxy with Java

This tutorial will walk you through the following steps:

1. Using Gradle to set up a new Java project.
2. Using the [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) framework for controlling the call.
3. Purchasing a number and configuring your Nexmo account to use that number with your application.

### Using Gradle to Setup a New Java Project

You will use Gradle to manage your dependencies and to create and run your Java application.

The `gradle init --type=java-application` command will create all of the folders you will need as well as a sample class where you will be writing your code.

From the command line, create a new Java project with the following commands, accepting any of the default prompts from Gradle:

```bash
mkdir forward-phone-call
cd forward-phone-call
gradle init --type=java-application
```

Gradle will create the `App` class in the `src/main/java/forward/phone/call` folder. 

Inside of this class is a `getGreeting` and `main` method. You wonâ€™t need the `getGreeting` method, so feel free to remove it.

Your `App` class should look like this:

```java
/*
 * This Java source file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.
 */
package forward.phone.call;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Future Code Goes Here
    }
}
```

### Using the Spark Framework for Controlling the Call

You will use the Spark framework to receive an HTTP call made by Nexmo when your number gets a call.

#### Adding the Dependencies

Add the following to the `dependencies` block in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
// Spark Framework
implementation 'com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.8.0'

// Nexmo Java Client
implementation 'com.nexmo:client:4.2.1'
```

Your `dependencies` block should look like this:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.8.0'
    implementation 'com.nexmo:client:4.2.1'
 
    // Use JUnit test framework
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
}
```

#### Define the Answer Route

When a call is received, Nexmo will send a request to a pre-defined webhook URL. It expects to receive a [Nexmo Call Control Object (NCCO)](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference) containing a list of actions to execute.

You will be using the `connect` action to forward incoming calls to Nexmo to your phone. The `connect` action is used to connect calls to endpoints such as phone numbers.

This is the resulting NCCO that your application will create:

```json
[
    {
        "endpoint": [
            {
                "number": "16165551234",
                "type": "phone"
            }
        ],
        "from": "16165559876",
        "action": "connect"
    }
]
```

You will use the `ConnectAction` and `PhoneEndpoint` classes from the Nexmo Java Client Library for building the above NCCO.

This will require two variables, the phone number that you want to connect calls to, and the Nexmo number you want to make the call with.

First, define the phone number you want to connect calls to by adding the following constant to the `App` class. The phone number you replace it with should start with a country code and no leading `+`:

```java
private static final String YOUR_SECOND_NUMBER = "16165551234";
```

Nexmo sends the `to` parameter to your webhook which contains the Nexmo number that was called. You can use this same number to call you by adding it as a `from` parameter.

Now define the answer route by adding the following code to the `main` method of the `App` class, resolving any imports:

```java
/*
* Route to answer incoming calls with an NCCO response.
*/
Route answerRoute = (req, res) -> {
    String nexmoNumber = req.queryParams("to");

    ConnectAction connect = ConnectAction.builder()
            .endpoint(PhoneEndpoint.builder(YOUR_SECOND_NUMBER).build())
            .from(nexmoNumber)
            .build();

    res.type("application/json");

    return new Ncco(connect).toJson();
};
```

#### Register the Answer Route

To use the answer route, you need to configure Spark. Your application will listen on port `3000`, and the route will be configured on `/webhooks/answer`.

Add the following to the `main` method of the `App` class:

```java
Spark.port(3000);
Spark.get("/webhooks/answer", answerRoute);
```

### Purchasing a Number

You will need a Nexmo number to receive phone calls. If you do not have a number you can use the Nexmo CLI to purchase one:

```bash
nexmo number:buy --country_code US
```

Take note of the number that is assigned to you. You will need this number to link your application and for testing.

### Exposing Your Application

To send an HTTP request to your application, Nexmo needs to know the URL that your application is running on.

Instead of configuring your local network or hosting your application on an external service, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your application to the internet safely.

Download ngrok and run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Take note of the forwarding address as you will need it when you configure your account. In the following picture, the forwarding address is `http://99cad2de.ngrok.io`.

![Screenshot of ngrok running in a terminal with forwarding address http://99cad2de.ngrok.io](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ngrok.png)

### Configure Your Nexmo Account

If you do not have an application you can use the Nexmo CLI to create one using your ngrok forwarding address:

```bash
nexmo app:create "Forward Call Demo" http://your-ngrok-forwarding-address/webhooks/answer http://your-ngrok-forwarding-address/webhooks/events --keyfile private.key
```

After running this command, you will be shown an application id. For example: `notreal-1111-2222-3333-appid`. You will need this application id to link your phone number to the application.

You can use the Nexmo CLI to link your phone number and application:

```bash
nexmo link:app your-nexmo-phone-number your-application-id
```

### Test Your Application

Start your application with the `gradle run` command inside of your `forward-phone-call` directory.

Grab a friend, colleague, or a second phone and call your Nexmo number. Your other phone should start ringing. Upon answering the phone, you will both be connected as if you called each other directly.

## Conclusion

In a few lines of code, you have created an application that can forward phone calls from your Nexmo number to your personal phone.
