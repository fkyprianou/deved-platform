I'm Steve Lorello, and I'm ecstatic to join the Developer Relations Team here at Nexmo.

I live in the city of Melbourne, FL situated right in the heart of Florida's 'Space Coast', where the weather is warm, the beaches are endless, and you can watch rockets launch into space from your backyard.

I've spent the bulk of my career in technology working in the .NET stack. With it, I've helped hundreds of developers with various integrations. Prior to which, I helped build Air Traffic Control Systems and more than one of those satellites we watch get launched from our backyards.

Consequentially there's a lot I've seen and done in the .NET world. Because of this, I know how many of you think and I have a lot of experience that I will bring to bear to make your integrations with Nexmo as frictionless and productive as possible.

When I'm not at work, I take long runs with my dogâ€”a 15-month-old whippet named Zero. I watch a fair amount of baseball (Go Yankees!), football (American, go Steelers!). I'm also working on my graduate studies and I absolutely love to travel the world with my wife. We've been all over the Caribbean, US, UK, France, Italy, and most recently, Southeast Asia and Japan.

I'm looking forward to working with you all and building up our developer community at large and our .NET community in particular.
