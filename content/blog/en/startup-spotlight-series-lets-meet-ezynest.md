The commercial real estate industry is continually being disrupted through the rise of what is called "space-as-a-service". Space-as-a-service (SPaaS) as a concept has evolved massively over the past couple of decades and is a paradigm shift in the way in which the commercial real estate industry operates.

New entrants in this market provide digital platforms for individuals or established businesses to monetize their unused space at home, the workplace, or elsewhere. This provides a great opportunity for property owners but also wider, more flexible options for renters. This disruption has led to an evolution in the type of spaces available on the market, anywhere from storage facilities and living spaces to curbsides and gardens.

One of the ambitious new startups aiming to disrupt this market even further is Dallas-based Ezynest. Madhu Korepu, one of Ezynest’s founders, caught up with us this week and explained their big plans for the future.

## The startup at a glance

**Startup Name**:  [Ezynest LLC](https://ezynest.com/)

**Industry**: Space-as-a-Service

**Location**: Plano, Dallas, TX

**Date founded**: June 2021

**Number of employees**: 8

**Vonage API used**: Verify

## In one sentence, what does Ezynest do?

Space Sharing Redefined - Finding Rooms, Storage, Parking lots and Subleasing has never been easier until now in your neighborhood.

## What is the problem you are solving? Was this the initial problem or did you pivot?

The problem we are trying to solve remains the same since day 1. Currently, there is no easy way to find cheap private storage, rooms, parking lots, and sublease (cars and apartments) in many nearby neighborhoods.

## What differentiates Ezynest from your competitors? Is there a secret sauce?

We are a super app that deals with all the services related to space renting. We are also building AI predictions & Machine learning algorithms to maximize conversion rate which should put us apart from our competitors. We also provide free 24*7 help centers, verified user communities and we are proud to be as cost-effective as possible to end-users.

## VC, Angel, Bootstrap, or Other?

We are currently bootstrapped. 

## What’s the biggest challenge you faced and how did you overcome it?

To make the app user experience and retention as effective as possible by connecting the host and renter in as few easy steps as possible.

## The biggest mistake Ezynest has made so far and what did you learn from it?

Initially, we did not concentrate on the user experience, we only focused on development during our previous MVP so we have since taken a lot of valuable feedback from users, startup meets, and investors. We have learned from this feedback and implemented changes to the current app version to make the user experience as smooth as possible to retain the users.  

## You can choose one to be on your board: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Gates. Who do you choose and why?  

Elon Musk, because he is a visionary. He believes dreams don't come true unless you envision them and work on them to make them a reality. 

## How have you been using Vonage’s APIs?

We have been using the Vonage Verify API to ensure users are legitimate for the current version of the app. Still, we have bigger plans of including your in-app messages API for better user communication and security.

## What progress have you made since launching? 

We launched the Ezynest mobile application on FEB14 on iOS and android platforms and shared it in our social circle, collected feedback, and worked on the bugs. We are also planning to concentrate on one major location to start marketing to reach the users as a starting point [ i.e Dallas, TX ] and gather insights.

## What’s next for Ezynest? Where do you want to be in 3 years?

We want to expand in all the major cities of the USA and Canada and reach 1 million users with 250k Subscriptions, generating a revenue of up to 5 million a month.
