You've learned [how to send a text message](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/05/03/send-sms-messages-with-java-dr) from your Nexmo virtual number using the SMS API. Everything looks good: your application is error-free and the API returns `status: 0`, so you're pretty confident that your message has been sent.

But, unless you have direct access to the device associated with that number, how can you be sure that it was delivered?

Well, the good news is that many of the networks that Nexmo uses to carry your message will provide a delivery receipt. You can access that delivery receipt programmatically, and that's what we'll show you how to do in this post.

The bad news is that not all networks' delivery receipts are definite proof that your message was actually delivered, with operators in some countries being more reliable than others.

Some carriers will tell you that they received your message, but won't confirm if it arrived at the destination. Some will generate fake receipts. Others won't send any receipt at all. 

So, before you rely on delivery receipts as being a source of truth, check out the [Nexmo Knowledge Base](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204014863-What-will-I-receive-if-a-network-country-does-not-support-Delivery-Receipts-) for country-specific information.

To request a delivery receipt you must create a publicly-accessible [webhook](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/webhooks) and configure your Nexmo account to use it. We will be using Java and the [Spark web framework](https://sparkjava.com) to create the webhook. You can find the code for this tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/java-get-delivery-receipt).

## Prerequisites

* The [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or its open source equivalent [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/). This tutorial was written using OpenJDK 11, but version 8 or above of either should be fine.
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) (version 3.4 or later) to build your project and manage its dependencies.
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to make your webhook available over the public Internet.

## Create Your Project

Create a directory for your project called `get-delivery-receipt`, change into that directory and then use `gradle` to initialize the project:

```sh
mkdir get-delivery-receipt
cd get-delivery-receipt
gradle init --type=java-application
```

Accept all the defaults, then open the generated project in your IDE.

## Initialize Dependencies

Locate the `build.gradle` file and change the dependency repository from `jcenter()` to `mavenCentral()`:

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Replace the `dependencies` section with the following:

```
dependencies {
    // Spark framework
    implementation 'com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.8.0'

    // Nexmo client library
    implementation 'com.nexmo:client:4.4.0'

    // To display formatted JSON
    implementation 'com.cedarsoftware:json-io:4.10.1'
}
```

## Create a Web Application Using Spark

Gradle created the `App` class in the `src/main/java/get/delivery/receipt` folder.

Open `App.java` in your IDE. Remove the `getGreeting()` method that `gradle` created for you and add the necessary `import` statements for the `spark` and `JsonWriter` packages.

Then, call Spark's `port` method to indicate that your application is listening for requests on port 3000.

Your `App.java` should look like this:

```java
package get.delivery.receipt;

import static spark.Spark.*;
import com.cedarsoftware.util.io.JsonWriter;

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        
        port(3000);

        // Your code goes here
    }
}
```

## Code the Delivery Receipt Webhook

When Nexmo receives a delivery receipt from a carrier, it checks your account configuration to see if you have provided the URL of a webhook endpoint. If so, Nexmo makes a request to this endpoint with the delivery receipt information.

By default, this is a `GET` request, so we'll code that first. The endpoint we will expose is `/webhooks/delivery-receipt`.

Add the following to your `main` method:

```java
get("/webhooks/delivery-receipt", (req, res) -> {
    System.out.println("DLR received via GET");
    for (String param : req.queryParams()) {
        System.out.printf("%s: %s\n", param, req.queryParams(param));
    }
    res.status(204);
    return "";
});
```

This code intercepts `GET` requests on your endpoint, strips out the delivery receipt information from the query string and writes it to `stdout`. It then returns HTTP status code `204` to tell Nexmo's APIs that the request was successful, but not to expect any content in the response.

## Handle POST Requests on Your Webhook

You can also configure your Nexmo account so that Nexmo supplies the delivery receipt by a `POST` request: either as a URL-encoded form or a JSON payload. 

So that your application can accept either `GET` or `POST` requests, add the following code to `App.java`:

```java
post("/webhooks/delivery-receipt", (req, res) -> {
    if (req.contentType().startsWith("application/x-www-form-urlencoded")) {
        System.out.println("DLR received via POST");
        for (String param : req.queryParams()) {
            System.out.printf("%s: %s\n", param, req.queryParams(param));
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("DLR received via POST-JSON");
        String prettyJson = JsonWriter.formatJson(req.body());
        System.out.println(prettyJson);
    }
    res.status(204);
    return "";
});
```

That's all the code you need to capture delivery receipts regardless of the HTTP method Nexmo uses to send them.

## Make Your Webhook Accessible

You must make your webhook accessible to Nexmo's APIs. A great way to do this during development is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). To learn more, read our [blog post on ngrok](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr).

Download and install `ngrok`, then execute the following command to expose your application on port 3000 to the public Internet:

```sh
ngrok http 3000
```

Make a note of the public URLs that `ngrok` provides and leave it running for the duration of this tutorial (because it gives you a new random URL every time you run it, unless you sign up for a [paid plan](https://ngrok.com/pricing)):

![Terminal showing the ngrok URLs](/content/blog/receiving-sms-delivery-receipts-with-java-and-spark/ngrok-urls.png "Terminal showing the ngrok URLs")

## Configure Your Nexmo Account

Now that you have a URL for your webhook, you must tell Nexmo to use it.

Log into the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) and under your account name in the left-hand navigation menu, select "Settings".

On the right-hand side of that page, under "Default SMS Setting", enter the full URL for your webhook (`ngrok` URL plus `/webhooks/delivery-receipt`) and click "Save changes". Note the option to be notified of delivery receipts via `POST` instead of the default `GET` HTTP method:

![Setting the delivery receipt webhook URL in the developer dashboard](/content/blog/receiving-sms-delivery-receipts-with-java-and-spark/dlr-settings.png "Setting the delivery receipt webhook URL in the developer dashboard")

## Try it Out

You're all set! Now you can test it.

Run your Java application from within your application directory:

```sh
gradle run
```

Use the Nexmo CLI to send a test message to your personal mobile number. This must include the country code, but exclude any leading zeroes. For example, use `447700900005` for the `GB` number `07700 900005`.

Here, we're setting the "from" number to be an alphabetic string, but this can be anything you want [within reason](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/guides/custom-sender-id):

```sh
nexmo sms -f NEXMOTEST YOUR_PERSONAL_NUMBER "This is a test message"
```

Once Nexmo receives a delivery receipt from the network, it forwards this to your application which then displays it:

```sh
GET request
network-code: 23420
price: 0.03330000
messageId: 1400022045C7C1E0
scts: 1907161527
to: NEXMOTEST
err-code: 0
msisdn: 447700900005
message-timestamp: 2019-07-16 14:27:43
status: delivered
```

Change the HTTP Method in the [dashboard settings page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) to one of the `POST` methods and send another SMS to ensure that your application can still retrieve the delivery receipt information. For example, `POST-JSON`:

```json
DLR received via POST-JSON
{
  "msisdn":"447700900005",
  "to":"NEXMOTEST",
  "network-code":"23420",
  "messageId":"140023462904E8",
  "price":"0.03330000",
  "status":"delivered",
  "scts":"1907171217",
  "err-code":"0",
  "message-timestamp":"2019-07-17 11:17:52"
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to create a Java application with the Spark framework to retrieve a delivery receipt from Nexmo using the SMS API. The webhook that you coded was able to extract the delivery receipt regardless of which HTTP method was used to make the request.
