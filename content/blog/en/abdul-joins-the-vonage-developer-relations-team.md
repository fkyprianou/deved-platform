Hey folks! My name is Abdul Ajetunmobi and I’m thrilled to be joining the Developer Relations team at Vonage. 

I was born and raised in South London and previously to Vonage I spent a few years working on consumer products as an iOS engineer. 

My introduction to Mobile Development was with Android before Android Studio reached 1.0, but I made the switch once Swift was announced in 2014.

During university, I got involved with the student hackathon community which took me to events all over the UK, Europe, and a few in the USA. Also, with a team of other students, we organised hackathons and other developer events to promote the developer community on our campus. 

Towards the end of my studies, I worked with the GitHub Education team to support community leaders in the London and South East England region. 

When I’m not working you’ll find me mentoring at the iOS [codebar](https://codebar.io) sessions, exploring Greenwich on my bike, taking photos, learning to read Japanese, or listening to some music. 

I am looking forward to working on the Client SDK team and supporting the iOS community! If you would like to reach out to me, feel free to drop me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abdulajet).
