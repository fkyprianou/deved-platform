And just like that, it’s Summer ‘22! Does anyone else feel like we just jumped straight from March to July? Ok, good to know it’s not just me!



We’ve continued our very busy [First Quarter](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/04/07/pushing-on-a-retrospective-of-q1-2022-at-vonage) into an action-packed Second Quarter. Documentation, SDKs, developer events, integrations, oh my! Don’t worry, we’ve put together some highlights to catch you up.


## Simplified Service
At Vonage, we’re always looking to improve our offerings. This can take various forms: new products, expanding products with exciting features, or making products easier to use by enhancing the developer experience. We want to help you get from point A to B in as few steps as possible. This quarter we simplified the user experience for two critical functions: our Status Page and our Messages API.




### Vonage API Status Page 
As of Monday, July 11th, there is a unified [Vonage API Status Page](https://vonageapi.statuspage.io/) for all Vonage API Services. If you haven’t already done so, please update your status page subscriptions and any automations that rely on those subscriptions to the new page. You can subscribe to email, text, Slack, RSS, or webhook notifications through the “Subscribe to Updates” button. This will ensure that you continue to receive the updates you need.


All Vonage API services are now included, with a greater degree of geographic granularity in SMS and Voice areas. Updates are grouped by product category, making it easy and fast to find a particular product status or announcement. Subscribe only to the components you are interested in to receive updates by email, Slack, SMS, or webhook.  Additionally, [uptime charts](https://vonageapi.statuspage.io/uptime) on the status page will now show the status and announcements history and allow you to jump straight to the announcements you’re interested in, based on date. 


### Vonage Messages API in the Server SDKs
The Messages API allows you to build omnichannel experiences for users with a single API. You can integrate SMS, MMS, Facebook Messenger, Viber, and WhatsApp, in any combination you like. 



[We’ve simplified using Messages API by allowing direct access from our SDKs](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/07/05/the-vonage-messages-api-is-now-in-our-server-sdks). Whether you’re using Ruby, Node, PHP, Python, Java, or .NET, you can let our SDKs handle the API boilerplate code and instead focus your energy on building applications.



## More Mobile


It’s hard to believe that our Android Advocate, Zachary, only joined the team in March. In just a few months, he’s been to events all over Europe, updated all our Android sample apps, become a Conversation API specialist, and much more. Learn about his work with Flutter and Quick Apps below.



### Getting Started with Flutter 3 and Vonage APIs
With the release of Flutter 3, it’s never been a better time to jump in and build cross-platform applications with a single codebase. [Learn to build a Flutter 3 application](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/05/19/getting-started-with-flutter-3-and-vonage-apis) which uses the Vonage Client SDKs to make voice calls.

### Flutter 3 Video Client SDK Example
Need to add video conferencing to your mobile application? Don’t maintain two codebases. You can use Flutter and the Vonage Video API to do all of this in one. [This Flutter + Vonage Video API application](https://github.com/Vonage-Community/sample-video-flutter-app) shows you how.

### Vonage Joins the OW2 Quick App Initiative
Have you heard of Quick Apps? Quick Apps are light, native-like mobile applications. These mini-apps don’t require installation and run directly on the mobile OS.

Quick Apps do this by implementing the emerging W3C MiniApp standards using a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework with a declarative user interface and predefined components to design reactive apps. Learn how [Vonage is supporting Quick Apps](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/05/05/vonage-joins-the-ow2-quick-app-initiative).


## Video Personalized Experiences

You must remember that in Q1 we announced that the Video API feature called ["Experience Composer" was in Beta](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/04/07/pushing-on-a-retrospective-of-q1-2022-at-vonage#experience-composer-beta-announced). Now, our customer solution engineer, Javier Molina Sanz, has written a post that shows [why Experience Composer API is great](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/07/12/why-experience-composer-api-is-great) and how you can use it to add new customized video streams to existing Vonage sessions. Also, Experience Composer will be GA soon, so stay tuned!


## Lagniappe
I spent my university years in Louisiana, where there’s a great concept called Lagniappe, meaning “a little bit extra.” This quarter we had a lot of extra to share; [new releases](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/categories/release), [tutorials](https://developer.vonage.com/blog), [events](https://developer.vonage.com/community/past-events) and more. But the extra extra is our plugin for WordPress: without any coding, so many sites can be secured with Two-Factor Authentication! 


### WordPress 2FA Plugin
There are estimated to be over 450 million websites built with WordPress. Whoa, that’s a big number! Fortunately, securing all those sites with 2FA has never been easier now that the [Vonage 2FA WordPress plugin](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/06/14/wordpress-2fa-by-vonage-is-here) exists.

## Stay In The Loop
We have much more coming in Q3. Join us on [Community Slack](https://developer.vonage.com/community/slack), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VonageDev), or meet us at an upcoming [event](https://developer.vonage.com/community) to stay on top of all Vonage news for Developers!

And please, let us know how we’re doing. We love your feedback.
