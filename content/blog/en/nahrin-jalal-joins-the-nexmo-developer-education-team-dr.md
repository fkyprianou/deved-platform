Hello! My name is Nahrin, and I’m delighted to be joining the Nexmo Developer Education team. 

Before moving to Canada over a decade ago, I had the privilege of living in some truly spectacular countries, including Sudan, Mali, Djibouti, Kenya, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tajikistan, and Haiti. Although I still enjoy exploring new places, I’m now happy to call Toronto home. Toronto is a terrific place to live, and I love kayaking through the surrounding Great Lakes or catching a Raptors basketball game in my spare time. 
 
As I've taken a non-traditional route to software engineering, ensuring that technical education is accessible to all is especially important to me. To this end, I have taught software development to students of varying demographics as an educator at <a href="http://uforchange.org/creative-intensive/graphic-design-and-web-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UforChange</a> and <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canada Learning Code</a>. Additionally, I have built a STEM learning management system using React.js and Python, judged and mentored at hackathons, and coordinated numerous technical workshops and events as Lead of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Toronto/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Women Who Code Toronto</a>.

Now, as Nexmo’s newest Developer Educator, my work revolves around creating resources that help and inspire developers using our communications APIs. This role deeply incorporates my passions for cutting-edge technology, education, and community—and I could not be more excited to have landed here.
