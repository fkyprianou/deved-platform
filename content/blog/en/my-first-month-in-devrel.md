## Overview

I am a software developer turned developer advocate. Every day when I wake up, it seems like a dream to me. I am a lifelong learner. Having the opportunity to share what I learn with the community is truly important to me.

I'm completing one month working as a Developer Advocate at Vonage. I thought I would share some resources and insights on what the journey has been like so far.

![Welcome note from the Vonage Team](/content/blog/my-first-month-in-devrel/pxl_20210610_121009759.jpg "welcome note")

## What I have been up to in this first month

During this first month:

* Onboarding
* Talked to HR
* Chose Benefits
* Met the team (virtually)
* Set up hardware & software

I have been:

  * Learning the internal processes and the APIs
  * Learning how to use new pieces of software
  * Supporting events, answering questions in the chats
  * Understanding challenges
  * Participating in developer communities and forums
  * Giving talks and workshops
  * Updating blog posts and documentation
  * Creating content in different formats. One example of what I've created:  [Send and Receive SMS Messages with Firebase Functions | One Dev Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8gHy_KvQAE) 
  * Giving and receiving code and content review ðŸ’–

## Working Remotely

Working remotely with people with different timezones works indeed. To me, the secret is making the best use of everyone's time; to make sure that the discussed topics are available, may it be via notes or recorded meetings. Whilst everyone is online and talking synchronously, the calls should have an agenda.

## Resources to share

I have gathered some resources that have personally helped me understand better what Developer Relations are. Let me share them with you:

### Conclusion

My goal is to bring awareness and create relationships with the developer community. I would love to have constructive conversations, communicate and get feedback from the community.

I am a curious and avid learner. It has been an absolute joy to work as a developer advocate. When I learn something, I think to myself: how can this turn into a nice demo?
