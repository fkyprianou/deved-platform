After a successful Beta test period, the [Vonage Video API MacOS SDK](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/mac/) has released its first stable release!

The macOS SDK joins the JavaScript, Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux SDKs as an officially supported client SDK for the Video API. 

With a stable release, developers can be confident that the macOS SDK is now production ready and will receive the same level of support and updates as the other stable client SDKs.
