In my previous post, I showed how we can set up translation of text messages with the [Google Translation API](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2019/10/24/extending-nexmo-google-cloud-translation-api-dr). I will continue with that same idea in this post using AWS Translate.

## Overview
In this post, I show you how to create an [inbound Nexmo SMS](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/guides/inbound-sms) webhook and translate the message into English using the [AWS Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/).  

In order to get started, you will need the following items setup:

+ [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
+ [Nexmo CLI installed](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli#installation)

<sign-up></sign-up>

## Create Your Project

The setup for this example is minimal, and you only need a couple of packages to get going.

+ [`aws-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk) - this is the official AWS Translate SDK
+ [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - web framework to serve the webhook
+ [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - a package to load environment variables
+ [`body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) - middleware for Express to handle the incoming webhook object

Initialize the project and then install the above requirements using `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
npm init && npm install aws-sdk express dotenv body-parser
# or
yarn init && yarn add aws-sdk express dotenv body-parser
```

Once installed, create an `index.js` and `.env` file.

```bash
touch index.js .env
```

Next, open the `index.js` file and put the following code inside:

```js
'use strict';
require('dotenv').config();

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

const server = app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Express server listening on port ${server.address().port} in ${app.settings.env} mode`);
});
```

This will set up the server to run the example.

### Installing ngrok

Webhooks need to be publicly available so that the Nexmo service can reach the application when incoming SMS messages are received. You could push your code up to a publicly available server, or you can use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com) to allow for public traffic to reach your local application.

You can learn more about installing `ngrok` with [this post](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr). After you have everything ready to go you can start ngrok using the following command to create your tunnel.

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Make a note of the `ngrok` address, as you will need that in a later step.


## Setting Up AWS Translate

Once you have the initial items set up, you can now create an IAM User with the AWS Translate role attached.

![Create New IAM User](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iam_add_user.png "Create New IAM User")

Give the new user a name, and check the box for `Programmable Access`.

![Set User Details](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/set_user_details.png "Set User Details")

Next the IAM user will require the `TranslateFullAccess` policy attached. This will give the IAM user access to the Translate functionality.

![Set User Permissions](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/set_permissions.png "Set User Permissions")

Review the user settings, and then click `Create`.

![Review and Create User](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/review_user.png "Review and Create User")

Once the creation process is complete, get the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`.

![Get the Access Key ID and Secret](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/access_key_secret.png "Get the Access Key ID and Secret")


Create a new `.env` file, and copy and paste the following:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
```

Using the credentials from the IAM user just created, fill in the details in the `.env` file, save, and continue on to create the Nexmo phone number.

## Setting Up Nexmo Inbound SMS Messages

This example requires a phone number from Nexmo to receive inbound messages. We can do this by using the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli#installation) right from a terminal.

### Purchase a Virtual Phone Number

The first step will be to purchase a number (feel free to use a different [ISO 3166 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) country code as needed).

```bash
nexmo number:buy --country_code US
```

Although the actual route to use in the application isn't set up, you will name it `/message`. The phone number needs to be linked to this route so inbound messages know where to go. Get the `ngrok` host name from the previous setup and use it here:

```bash
nexmo link:sms phone_number https://my-ngrok-hostname/message
```

Now we have the Nexmo webhook setup as a place for inbound SMS messages to be routed.  

## Finish the Application

All that is left for this tutorial is creating the Express route to handle the incoming data and a couple of small functions to actually perform the translation.

### Build the Webhook

First, we need to build the webhook code. Nexmo has a built in feature for setting default SMS behavior.  [In the settings panel](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) you can change the default `HTTP` method used. Mine is set to `POST-JSON`. I would recommend using this setting if possible, however the code used in this example will handle all three options in case you are unable to modify this setting.

![Default Nexmo SMS HTTP Method](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/default-sms-settings.png "Default Nexmo SMS HTTP Method")


Open up the `index.js` file, and at the bottom, paste the following code:

```js
// Reading the inbound SMS messages
const handleRoute = (req, res) => {

  let params = req.body;

  if (req.method === "GET") {
    params = req.query
  }

  if (!params.to || !params.msisdn) {
    res.status(400).send({'error': 'This is not a valid inbound SMS message!'});
  } else {
    translateText(params);
    res.status(200).end();
  }

};
```

The above snippet is the method we will pass into the routes.  If the incoming messages is using `POST` it will use `req.body`, and it will use `req.query` for the `GET` option. As long as the inbound payload is properly set up, the object will be sent along to the `translateText` method to display the translation.

Now you can add the route and proper `HTTP` methods to the application.

```js
app.route('/message')
  .get(handleRoute)
  .post(handleRoute)
  .all((req, res) => res.status(405).send());
```

The above code will create the `GET` and `POST` methods to handle either from the inbound SMS webhook message.  If any other method is used, a `405 - Method Not Allowed` response will be returned.

The webhook is ready to go and the final piece is the actual translations.

### Translation Method

In the previous step we call `translateText`. This step will create that method.

Using the `aws-sdk` package is really straight forward. We first instantiate the `AWS.Translate` class, which will give us the `translate.translateText` method. This is called within `translateText` method and uses the `text` field from the inbound SMS message object. The `SourceLanguageCode` language is set to `auto`, and the `TargetLanguageCode` input is any two-letter code for the [language to translate into](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html#language-pairs).

```js
function translateText(params) {
  var translate = new AWS.Translate({region: process.env.AWS_REGION})
  var opts = {
    SourceLanguageCode: 'auto',
    TargetLanguageCode: 'en',
    Text: params.text
  };
  translate.translateText(opts, function(err, data) {
    if (err) {
      console.log('error', err);
    }
    else{
      console.log(`Original Text: ${params.text}`);
      console.dir(`Translation: ${data.TranslatedText}`);
    }
  });
}
```


Now you can test out the functionality by starting the server, and sending a text message to the number you purchased earlier.

```shell
node index.js
# Text "Hola" to your phone number

# expected response
Original Text: Hola
Translation: Hello
```

The AWS Translate does an amazing job at detecting the incoming language and processing the translation quickly. Have fun and try it out.


## Recap

The example above is just a small introduction to translation, but should be a good start to get you going. From here you can translate the inbound message, and then translate the outbound message into the correct language as well (future blog post, for sure).
