In this blog post, we are going to implement a loudness detector that could be used to avoid one of the most common situations that happened during the pandemic: 

> *Hey, You Are Muted*.


[The code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-se/opentok-mic-volume-detector).

## Concepts

Vonage Video API has three main concepts: session, publisher and subscriber. You can think of a session as a virtual room in which people can speak (publish audio and/or video) and listen (subscribe) to each other. Letâ€™s focus on the **publisher** concept. A publisher represents the view of a video you publish:

```javascript
const publisher = OT.initPublisher("publisherContainer", 
{ publishAudio: true, publishVideo: true }, function(error) {
  if (error) {
    // The client cannot publish.
  } else {
    console.log('Publisher initialized.');
  }
});
```

The `publisher` object is composed of an `audioTrack` and a `videoTrack`. It's possible to monitor the audio level of the `audioTrack` using a listener on the `publisher` object. The event is called [`audioLevelUpdated`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/js/reference/Publisher.html#event:audioLevelUpdated). The `audioLevelUpdate` event periodically dispatches the audio level of the publisher if the microphone is active.

If the Publisher has muted their microphone using the `publishAudio(false)` function, the event will fire with `audioLevel` equal to 0. Since our goal is to catch the `audioLevel` when the microphone is muted, we need to find a way to get the audio level even when the microphone is muted.

The idea is to create an `AudioContext` on the `audioDevice` used by the Publisher. It's possible to get the `deviceId` of the Publisher using [`getAudioSource`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/js/reference/Publisher.html#getAudioSource). Then, we need to get an additional `MediaTrack` using `getUserMedia`:

```javascript
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
     audio: {
       deviceId: selectedMicrophoneId,
  },
});

```

An `AudioContext` is the first element that we need to process an Audio Node. The next step is to connect the `audioStream` to the `AudioContext` and create an Analyser using `createAnalyser`: 

```javascript
const source = loudnessDetector.audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(
  loudnessDetector.stream
);
const analyser = loudnessDetector.audioContext.createAnalyser();

source.connect(analyser);

```

### Detect Loudness

Using the audio level given by the analyser, we can detect if the user is speaking. If so, the application should show a message on the UI alerting the user that they are speaking with their microphone muted. 

The sample code is displaying a mute indicator when it detects that the audio level is beyond a specific threshold. Once the threshold is reached, it turns on the mute indicator and turns off the detector for a certain amount of time (for example 5 seconds). After that, the timeout hides the indicator and activates the detector again:

```javascript 
if (!muteIndication && turnMuteIndicationOffTimer === -1) {
  this.turnLoudnessDetectorOff();
  turnMuteIndicationOffTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    // turn off the mute indicator and toggle the loudnessDetector
    this.turnMuteIndicationOff();
    this.turnLoudnessDetectorOn({
      selectedMicrophoneId,
      isAudioEnabled,
    });
  }, 5000);

  // turn loudness indicator ON
  muteIndication = true;
  this.toggleLoudnessDetector();
}
```

# Conclusion

In this blog post we explained how to create a loudness detector that can be integrated into your video platform to improve the user experience. It's up to your application to decide how to react to the event. It can show a simple message on the frontend, open a toast message or play an audio alert to the muted user.
