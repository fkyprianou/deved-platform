# Imagining New Possibilities

Each new year is a new opportunity to change, grow, and imagine new possibilities for ourselves. As the first quarter of 2023 ends, it’s a good time to reflect on the opening chapter of the year.
In Vonage, we’re proud to look back at Q1 and see we’ve realized quite a few of our resolutions. Whether imagining new products or reimagining products by adding new opportunities, we’ve opened the year by opening doors for our developers with new programmable possibilities. 

## New Products

Creating robust software is our passion. But powerful software requires an equally enjoyable user experience to generate adoption. We’re excited to debut two new products this quarter that bring user experience to center stage: Proactive Connect and Silent Authentication.

### Getting Started With Proactive Connect

Does your business need to manage campaigns for users, leads, or other large-scale contact groups? Of course, it does! Now with [Proactive Connect](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/getting-started-with-the-campaign-manager-api-and-ui), you can schedule and send personalized messages, across multiple channels, to different large-scale contact groups. But the coolest part is that you can now do it all through a GUI interface built into your Developer Dashboard!

### Silent Authentication

Users expect your software to be safe and secure. But they don’t want to jump through a million hoops like filling out a One-time password (OTP) or installing Authenticator Applications to ensure their identity. Thankfully, there’s a new paradigm in security: [Silent Authentication](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/introducing-vonage-silent-authentication).

## New Features

Our goal at Vonage is to empower our developers to delight their end users. Our Messages API and Video API recently debuted some new capabilities that provide even more flexibility and security. Try them out and build something delightful! 

### Using WhatsApp Product Messages With Messages API

Millions of users love WhatsApp for its rich features. Way beyond simple text messaging, users can send multimedia messages, fun button replies, list messages, locations, and so much more.

One of the most significant advances for businesses is the launch of [Product Messages](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/using-whatsapp-product-messages-with-the-vonage-messages-api). This new message type allows a company to showcase products and services, and customers can browse and add products to a cart without leaving the WhatsApp conversation.

## Enhance your Vonage Video Applications with Audio Connector

Developers usually focus on the video component of video calls. But why? There are so many interesting applications to improve the video call experience when you can access and transmit the audio.\
Our [Audio Connector](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/enhance-your-vonage-video-applications-with-audio-connector) does just that! It lets you send raw audio streams from a Vonage Video session, via your own WebSocket server, to external services for further processing. Some use cases are transcription, translation, content moderation, and more!

### Secure your Inbound Media files with the Vonage Messages API 

With [WhatsApp Messages](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/secure-your-inbound-media-files-with-the-vonage-messages-api), users can send a lot more than just text. But what if those photo or video messages contain some sensitive information? You better be sure they are secure. By clicking one button in your developer dashboard and generating a JWT you can!
