## Introduction

In a previous tutorial, we showed you how to create an application that can [Receive a Phone Call with Java](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/08/09/receive-a-phone-call-with-java-dr/). In this tutorial, you will create an application that can receive a phone call and respond to user input using the [Nexmo Voice API](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/overview).

## Prerequisites

To work through this tutorial, you will need a Vonage account. Sign up now if you don't already have an account.

You will be using [Gradle](https://gradle.org) to manage your dependencies and run your application. Additionally, you'll need to make sure you have a copy of the JDK installed. I will be using JDK 8 in this tutorial.

## Handle User Input with Java

This tutorial will walk you through the following steps:

1. Using [Gradle](https://gradle.org) to setup a new Java project.
2. Using the [Spark](http://sparkjava.com) framework for controlling the call.
3. Purchasing a number and configuring your Nexmo account to use that number with your application.

### Using Gradle to Setup a New Java Project

You will use [Gradle](https://gradle.org) to manage your dependencies and to create and run your Java application. From the command line, create a new Java project with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir handle-user-input
cd handle-user-input
gradle init --type java-application
```

The `gradle init --type java-application` command will create all of the folders you will need as well as a sample class where you will write your code.

### Using the Spark Framework for Controlling the Call

You will use the [Spark](http://sparkjava.com) framework to intercept the HTTP call that Nexmo uses when your number receives a call, and for the request that Nexmo sends when input is received.

#### Adding the Dependencies

Add the following to your `dependencies` block in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
compile 'com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.7.2'
compile 'com.nexmo:client:4.0.1'
```

Your `dependencies` block should look like this:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // This dependency is found on compile classpath of this component and consumers.
    compile 'com.google.guava:guava:23.0'
    compile 'com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.7.2'
    compile 'com.nexmo:client:4.0.1'

    // Use JUnit test framework
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
}
```

#### Setup the Answer Route

[Gradle](https://gradle.org) will create the `App` class in the `src/main/java` folder. Inside of this class is a `getGreeting` and a `main` method. You won't need the `getGreeting` method, so feel free to remove it.

Replace the contents of the `main` method, resolving any imports, with:

```java
/*
* Route to answer incoming calls.
*/
Route answerRoute = (req, res) -> {
    TalkAction intro = new TalkAction
            .Builder("Hello. Please press any key to continue.")
            .build();

    InputAction input = new InputAction.Builder()
            .eventUrl(String.format("%s://%s/webhooks/dtmf", req.scheme(), req.host()))
            .maxDigits(1)
            .build();


    res.type("application/json");

    return new Ncco(intro, input).toJson();
};

/*
* Route to print out call event info.
*/
Route eventRoute = (req, res) -> {
    System.out.println(req.body());
    return "";
};

Spark.port(3000);
Spark.get("/webhooks/answer", answerRoute);
Spark.post("/webhooks/events", eventRoute);
```

This code will setup a route on <http://localhost:3000/webhooks/answer> which will respond with the following [Nexmo Call Control Object (NCCO)](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference):

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Hello please press any key to continue.",
    "action": "talk"
  },
  {
    "maxDigits": 1,
    "action": "input",
    "eventUrl": [
      "http://localhost:3000/webhooks/dtmf"
    ]
  }
]
```

The talk action will instruct Nexmo to speak the `text` property back to the caller. The input action will instruct Nexmo to capture a single digit that the caller inputs and to send a POST request to `eventUrl` with this information.

A route will also be setup on <http://localhost:3000/webhooks/events> which Nexmo will use to communicate call status changes.

#### Setup the DTMF Route

When the caller presses a digit on their device, a Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signal is created. Nexmo uses this DTMF signal to determine which set of keys were pressed. Once this happens, Nexmo sends a POST request to the `eventUrl` defined in the `InputNcco`.

Here is an example of the POST request which contains a JSON body:

```json
{
    "dtmf": "5",
    "timed_out": false,
    "uuid": "some-uuid",
    "conversation_uuid": "some-conversation",
    "timestamp": "2018-08-14T19:59:02.528Z"
}
```

In order to read this information in Java, you will need to a class which will map the JSON properties to Java properties. The Nexmo Java Client Library contains the `InputEvent` class for handing this mapping.

In the `main` method of the `App` class add the following route below the `eventRoute`:

```java
/*
* Route which returns NCCO saying which DTMF code was received.
*/
Route inputRoute = (req, res) -> {
    InputEvent event = InputEvent.fromJson(req.body());

    TalkAction response = new TalkAction
            .Builder(String.format("You pressed %s, Goodbye.", event.getDtmf()))
            .build();

    res.type("application/json");

    return new Ncco(response).toJson();
};
```

Next, register the route by adding the following at the end of the `main` method:

```java
Spark.post("/webhooks/dtmf", inputRoute);
```

This route will respond with the following [NCCO](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference):

```json
[
  {
    "text": "You pressed 6, Goodbye.",
    "action": "talk"
  }
]
```

where 6 is the `dtmf` property of the json sent to `/webhooks/dtmf`.

### Purchasing a Number

You will need a Nexmo number in order to receive phone calls. If you do not have a number you can use the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli) to purchase one:

```bash
nexmo number:buy --country_code US
```

Take note of the number that is assigned to you on purchase. You will need this number to link your application and for testing.

### Exposing Your Application

In order to send an HTTP request to your application, Nexmo needs to know the URL that your application is running on.

Instead of configuring your local network or hosting your application on an external service, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to safely expose your application to the internet.

Download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Take note of the forwarding address as you will need it when you configure your account. In the following picture, the forwarding address is `http://99cad2de.ngrok.io`.

![Screenshot of ngrok running in terminal with forwarding address http://99cad2de.ngrok.io](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ngrok.png "screenshot of ngrok")

### Configure Your Nexmo Account

If you do not have an application you can use the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli) to create one using your [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) forwarding address:

```bash
nexmo app:create "Receive Call Demo" http://your-ngrok-forwarding-address/webhooks/answer http://your-ngrok-forwarding-address/webhooks/events --keyfile private.key
```

After running this command, you will be shown an an application id. For example: `notreal-1111-2222-3333-appid`. You will need this application id to link your phone number to the application.

You can use the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli) to link your phone number and application:

```bash
nexmo link:app your-nexmo-phone-number your-application-id
```

This command instructs Nexmo to create a new application on your account. The application will send a request to the first URL when it receives a phone call. The application will send requests to the second URL when the call status changes.

### Test Your Application

Start your application with the `gradle run` command inside of your `handle-user-input` directory.

Make a call to your Nexmo number and test out your application. You will hear the message, "Hello please press any key to continue." Press a digit on your phone's keypad and you will then hear the message, "You pressed 6, Goodbye" where 6 is the number that you pressed.

## Conclusion

In a few lines of code you have created an application that can receive a phone call, capture user input, and respond with that input. Experiment with other ways you can use a user's input to control the call.
