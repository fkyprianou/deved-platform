*This is the first article in a series of “Getting Started with Vonage and Node-RED” tutorials.*

The Vonage [SMS API](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/sms) allows you to send and receive SMS worldwide, using a simple HTTP-based API. 

The good news is, interacting with this API—and many others—just got easier with the addition of Nexmo nodes to the Node-RED palette.

In this article, you will learn how to send SMS messages with Node-RED.
Get this flow from the [Node-RED Library](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/570cfeef04a6502c7a24c0e9cfc3323a) or follow along.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you’ll need a few things:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation) installed on your machine
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) - get up to speed with [Aaron's blog post](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/)

## Getting Your Credentials

<sign-up number></sign-up>

While in some countries you can send an SMS without renting a Vonage Number, other countries like the USA will require you to own the number your SMS messages originate from.

## Setting Up Your Node-RED Editor

First, you’ll need to [install](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation) the runtime and editor. This could be done either on your local machine, on a Single Board Computer (eg Raspberry Pi), or a number of cloud-hosted options. This example will be using your local machine, so once you've installed Node-RED globally, just type the command below in your terminal to get started.

```bash
$ node-red
```

You can then access the Node-RED editor by pointing your browser at <http://localhost:1880>.

Once you have your editor open, you'll need to install the Nexmo nodes. You can do so under the *Manage palette* menu, by searching for the `node-red-contrib-nexmo` package and clicking install. 

![Install the Nexmo Node-RED package](/content/blog/how-to-send-sms-messages-with-node-red/install-nexmo-nodered.gif "Install the Nexmo Node-RED package")

Now you should see all of the Nexmo nodes appear on the left side of your screen, among the default nodes.

## Sending an SMS with Node-RED

Scroll down to the **`sendsms`** node and drag it into your workspace. This will do the heavy lifting in today's tutorial.

You can set up this node by double clicking on it and filling in the parameters below. You'll find `API KEY` and `API SECRET` by clicking on the edit button next to `Nexmo Credentials`. 

| KEY          | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `API KEY`    | Your API key, shown in your [account overview](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/getting-started-guide).                                                                                                                                                 |
| `API SECRET` | Your API secret, shown in your [account overview](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/getting-started-guide).                                                                                                                                              |
| `TO`         | The number you are sending the SMS to in E.164 format. For example 447401234567.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `FROM`       | The number or text shown on a handset when it displays your message. You can set a custom alphanumeric FROM to better represent your brand, if this feature is [supported in your country](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011781468). |
| `TEXT`       | The content of your message. Feel free to get creative, but a 'Hello World!' will do just as well.                                                                                                                                                 |

Next, add an **`inject`** node to the flow and wire it as an input for **`sendsms`**. 

This is quite a powerful one, it can initiate the flow with a specific payload value. It supports injecting strings, numbers, booleans, JavaScript objects, or flow/global context values, having the timestamp of the current time in millisecs since January 1st, 1970 as default.

You could simply use it to set off your flow, while hardcoding all parameters in the **`sendsms`** node, or you could take it a step further.

Next to the `TO`,`FROM` and `TEXT` parameters there is a `{}` sign, which means that [Mustache templating](https://mustache.github.io/) is supported for those fields. This comes in handy when passing certain values dynamically to the **`sendsms`** node.

Knowing that the timestamp is injected, let's add this value to the message text by referencing **`{{msg.payload}}`**, for example:

```
Hello World! The timestamp is `{{msg.payload}}`.
```

To have a bit more insight into what's happening when you send an SMS, wire the **`sendsms`**' output into a **`debug`** node. Double click on it and set the `Output` to `complete msg object`.

Hit **Deploy** and click the **`inject`** node's button - your SMS should be on its way!

![Sending an SMS in Node-RED](/content/blog/how-to-send-sms-messages-with-node-red/send-sms-flow.gif "Sending an SMS in Node-RED")

When you make a successful request to the SMS API, it returns an array of message objects. Ideally each of these have a \`status\` of \`0\`, indicating that your message has successfully been scheduled for sending, and a few other details like recipient number, message-id, remaining balance, price and the carrier network that will be used for sending the SMS. 

You can have a look at this response object in the debug area in the right side of your Node-RED editor.

While inspecting this output is quite helpful in determining what the SMS API did, there is no guarantee that the message reached the recipient's handset. 

When the message gets delivered, the mobile phone carrier returns a **[Delivery Receipt](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/guides/delivery-receipts)** to Vonage. This will contain the delivery status.

## Receiving a Delivery Receipt from a Mobile Carrier

To find out the `status` of your outbound message, you'll need to set up a webhook endpoint that Vonage can forward the **Delivery Receipt** to.

### Defining a Webhook Endpoint

First, connect a `http` input node to a `http response` node, as well as to a `debug` node, so that you can view your delivery receipt in the debug area.

In the `http` input node, select `POST` as a `Method` and fill in the `URL` field with something like `/receipt`.
The `http response` node should have `200` set as `Status code`, but don't worry about it, this is the default value as well.

### Exposing Your Local Server to the Internet

Next you'll have to expose your local server to the internet, so that Vonage can access it. A convenient way to do this is by using a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

[Download](https://ngrok.com/download) and install **ngrok**, then run it in the terminal to start a tunnel on port `1880`.

```shell
$ ./ngrok http 1880
```

![Starting an ngrok tunnel in a terminal window](/content/blog/how-to-send-sms-messages-with-node-red/ngrok-1880.png "Starting an ngrok tunnel in a terminal window")

Your local server now has a ngrok URL that can be used as your webhook endpoint.

### Setting Up the Endpoint with Vonage

The last step is letting the Vonage SMS API know where it should forward the delivery receipts. You can do so under your [API settings](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) in the **Default SMS Setting** section.

Set the default webhook URL for delivery receipts to `YOUR_NGROK_URL/receipt`, then `Save changes`.

![Delivery receipt endpoint URL in dashboard](/content/blog/how-to-send-sms-messages-with-node-red/delivery-receipt-endpoint-url.png "Delivery receipt endpoint URL in dashboard")

Now when you go back into your Node-RED editor and send another message, you'll see the delivery receipt appear in the debug area:

![Delivery receipt in debug sidebar](/content/blog/how-to-send-sms-messages-with-node-red/delivery-receipt-in-debug.png "Delivery receipt in debug sidebar")

The `status` and `err-code` parameters both indicate that the message has successfully been delivered. Learn more about delivery receipt status messages and error codes in the [docs](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/guides/delivery-receipts).
