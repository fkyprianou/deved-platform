## About the Hackathon

\
On November 5th and 6th, Vonage partnered with e& enterprise and Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Dubai Campus for the FutureNow Hackathon. The hackathon invited students from MAHE’s Computer Science program to compete in a 24 hour technical competition.

The hackathon kicked off with a workshop by Vonage Developer Advocate Benjamin Aronov. He gave an overview of Vonage APIs and then did a hands-on demo, building a WhatsApp agent using the Studio AI platform. Students learned about AI Studio’s drag and drop interface, powerful NLU engine, and how it can connect with outside services with API calls.\
\
\
The students were then challenged to leverage AI-driven Communication APIs to help organizations improve their relationships with customers. 9 teams submitted solutions using the Vonage AI Studio platform. The winning team was quadKernals. 

We asked the team more about their project and aspirations for a future working in technology.



## A﻿n Interview with quadKernals

#### What were the different roles in the team? Who did what?

\[Jaison + Shreesh] created the APIs along with Srish to interact with the one inch AI agents. Okay. So we learned how to interact with the Http AI agent. So that is the creating the session and then accessing the session and sending messages back and forth. And we also created the event access management system that is on the AI agent side.

\[Saina + Brandon] creating the sync between the video and audio of JIFFs. So I created the JIFFs, and then we had to basically sync the JIFS with the audio along with the mapping of the keywords to the Jiff. So depending on which keyword comes in, it maps it to a particular action. So we basically had four GIFs, and we had to map it to that. Another thing that Sonia did was she actually graphic design each of the states for Domino, and that's pretty much it. So the artwork was custom

\[Brandon] I made the text to speech interface work. It used to loop and loop and go on, and I fixed that. 

#### Are you all studying computer science? Yes. Okay, and let's just go one by one. But, like, what is your dream kind of job role after you finish your degree? What are you interested in doing? 

\[Brandon] Well, I would like to be a software engineer. And I could take projects outside our companies, but I would like to be more independent, like creating my own projects for myself. Do you want to be like a digital nomad kind of idea? I think a little bit of both. Okay, cool. And I don't know, you have something in code that you already found that you really love? Like back end? Front end? Yeah. I think I would be a full stack developer, but mainly my focus would be on back end. Okay. Your favorite class that you took so far in your sales degree? My favorite class? Yeah. You had one where I was like, oh, this is super interesting. You learned something. You like, it's OK if there's not. Yet, there's not. Okay, so we'll just say the hackathon was your favorite class. Okay. It's a hackathon. Yeah. No, it's okay. It's okay. It's definitely my favorite. 

\[Jaison] The job that pays the most. But in all seriousness, I got into CS to build solutions that impact, like, a lot of people. Because you could do that with computers, which you basically couldn't do with many other fields. Like, people have been applications that billions of people use. Okay, so being someone who can scale applications and at that level, that's what I want to do. Yeah, system architecture. I enjoyed our Networking course.

\[Saina] So I'm really interested in AI and ML. So we have just, I think, started our minors in that. And I want to do masters in artificial intelligence and machine learning. So that's the next step because I want to get a deeper understanding of all the neural networks and contribute some of my own products to it. Like, we see the research papers and the articles that come out, and it all seems really interesting to me. Build robots. 

\[Shreesh] My dream is to become a cybersecurity specialist, and as of now. We haven't had a lot of subjects that deeply interest us in cybersecurity. It's just like the base, and then we just leave it and leave us out. But I'm hoping to deepen my knowledge into cybersecurity and one day be a specialist. To defend, not attack. 

#### So very quickly, just, like, in three lines, say what the project that you. 

\[Jaison] We built a project called Domino. It’s a video interface for your chat application. We created a bot that was a bunch of GIFs and we mapped text to various outputs and actions. So according to what kind of text you would say, it would do the related action. So a “hi” would be a wave. When you’re talking, the bot would look like it was listening. When it was speaking, it would use the talking GIF. And if it didn’t understand something it would have a confused face.

#### What problem does it solve?

\[Saina] We went for event assistance as a usecase. When GITEX was in Dubai, it was a huge event. With a lot of workshops and stalls. So often we found ourselves lost in the layout. So often we had to look for a person working the event to ask where we were or where a particular session was being held or what time does the session start. So instead of that we thought instead of this, if we just had a chatbot to query “what time is so and so event?” and it gives you the answer. So it’s much faster and easier navigation through the whole event. And these kind of things can be handled by a chatbot to greatly improve user experience.

\[Jaison] And that’s just one use. But by building the interface of interacting with an animated character instead of just using text it improves the customer experience. So instead of trying to avoid speaking to the chatbot, they will enjoy the experience by talking to the character. 

#### What did you learn while building the project?

\[Brandon] I learned a lot of web development, which wasn’t really my specialty. I learned how to deal with the REST API requests and responses. And how we can use data to build new requests dynamically. Because the user text is not limited as the NLU allows them to enter answers naturally.

\[Jaison] What I had to do this time was go through the documentation very well. I couldn’t just copy an existing tutorial. Going through the documentation and figuring out how the APIs work. That was a new experience for me. Usually I don’t spend so long to understand how an API works. I enjoyed doing that.\
\
And it was really easy to create the chatbot. To create the bot was a lot easier than I thought it would be. Like normally when you read about creating Python chatbots, there’s alot of ML involved for the NLP layer and then your dictionaries, and then your cases and all that. But here you could just plug and play. Put what you needed and it would give you your output. And the Intents was so useful. Like you put some statements and then it continues suggesting other statements, you don’t have to build any of that. It’s already there! So being able to build something that complete and that quickly was really cool.  

\[Saina] This was the first time I delved into animation. And it was a very interesting experience. After that it was the syncing of the animation to the audio. When I got it working, the output was really nice. It felt good to somehow have managed to make it work. After the numerous times it broke in different ways, in different instances. So that was the fun part. 

#### What was the technical implementation of the project?

We wanted to create a SQL database but because of time constraints we used my-json-server to create a JSON object as a database and put it on GitHub and then use my-json-server to serve up that data. 

Our frontend was HTML and Vanilla JS. And with JavaScript we call the APIs, get back the JSON responses and then show it in the frontend. So the entire flow would be:

1. User sends a message
2. Message is sent to AI Studio which would do the processing through an HTTP agent and decide what the response should be
3. Then we give the response to our Text-To-Speech function to speak
4. And we would tell the talking bot which action to perform according to what was said

#### Any specific feature in AI Studio surprised you?

\[Jaison] Just how good the intents were. I had the query of “what event am I at?” so that’s for the location. So I added as the expression, “where is this location?”. And you could instead ask another keyword for it, like “destination”. And it wouldn’t struggle for it. It would realize, “oh yeah destination is there and where is is there” so it must be another location intent. And it would be able to pull context like that which was really, really cool. 

\[Saina] The suggestions for expressions were really accurate. After you put in one, you get a lot of suggestions that have somehow recognized what you are looking for. It’s really good. 

#### What’s Next For You As A Group and Individually?

We have our [University Tech Fest](https://technovanzadxb.web.app/html/index.html) coming up in a couple of weeks. And we wanted to make an interface for people to communicate over a plain WhatsApp bot. But now we can create the interactive way so people can find what they’re looking for at Tech Fest.

\[Brandon] I still have 3 years to go until graduation. Trying to participate in more activities to get real world experience, like this hackathon. And maybe win a couple more!

\[Jaison] Only a few months left for me until graduation. And the job market doesn’t look so great. But I have to start the job hunt. And also applying for Masters programs in Machine Learning and Systems Engineering.

\[Saina] Definitely a Masters in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I’m also finishing in a few months with Jaison.
