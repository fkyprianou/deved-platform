Hi there! My name is Jim (or James) Seconde, and I am absolutely delighted to be joining the Vonage Developer Relations as your resident PHP language Advocate!

For those that don’t know me in the PHP world, I have a fairly unusual background in tech, in that I am a trained actor. I graduated from the University of Chester in 2006 with a BA in Theatre Studies and English Literature - however, the more Developer Advocates I meet from across the world leads me to believe this isn’t actually that uncommon!

While doing theatre work at the super [Rosemary Branch Theatre](https://www.rosemarybranchtheatre.co.uk) in North London, I became a SQL Q/A, then a Business Intelligence developer before finally taking the plunge into full stack web development with PHP back in 2010. Not knowing how to get into the language and without a job in it, I just started ...going to meetups, to speak to people and to work out how to take my career in this direction. The rest, as they say, is history.

So, I’m a product of the meetup scene, and in 2018 I started speaking on stage (back to my roots) and writing on tech culture. In 2017 I moved to Birmingham and founded [the current PHP usergroup](https://twitter.com/brumphp), as well as becoming part of the [Fusion meetup team](https://thefusionhub.co.uk) as Community Lead.

When you don’t see me working on [our PHP core SDK](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-php-sdk-core) or writing/speaking on PHP (or other backend languages, I’m open minded to new experiences!), you can find me playing and collecting weird records on my podcast [The Dev Radio](https://devtheatre.net/dev-radio) or cooking average international dishes.
