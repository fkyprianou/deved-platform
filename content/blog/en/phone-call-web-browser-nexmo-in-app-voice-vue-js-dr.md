In this blog post we'll walk through how you can make a phone call from a web browser to a phone with [Vonage In-App Voice](https://developer.vonage.com/client-sdk/in-app-voice/overview) using the Vonage Client SDK for JavaScript and Vue.JS. In-App Voice and [In-App Messaging](https://developer.nexmo.com/stitch/in-app-messaging/overview) is in Developer Preview so we'd love your feedback on both the development experience that you have and on the functionality that's provided. You can get in touch via the [Vonage Developer Community Slack](https://developer.nexmo.com/community/slack).

In order to make a phone call from a web browser, we're going to need a number of components in our app. A Vue.JS application that runs in the browser and that uses the Vonage Client SDK for JavaScript, an application server used to authenticate the application user with Vonage by generating a User JWT, and a phone to receive the phone call.

The sequence diagram below shows how things will work once we've built our app. In this blog post, we'll first create the Vue.JS application with a UI that allows a phone number to be entered. We'll then create an application server that can generate the required User JWT. Once the app server is up and running we'll update the Vue.JS app to retrieve the JWT and use that with the Vonage Client SDK for JavaScript to login to the Vonage platform and initiate the phone call. We then need to update the app server to handle a GET request that Vonage will make in order to retrieve instructions for how to proceed with the phone call. Those instructions will tell Vonage to connect the call from the Vue.JS application in the web browser to a phone.

So, there are a few steps involved but the result is worthwhile.

If you'd rather dive straight into the code you can find the [Call from Browser code](https://github.com/nexmo-community/call-from-browser) on GitHub.

## Before we begin

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for package management
* The [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) for scaffolding out our app and running a dev server
* A [Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up) to enable us to use the SDK and make phone calls
* The [Vonage CLI](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-cli) to quickly create and setup a Vonage application from the command line. `npm install @vonage/cli -g`
* A local tunnel solution such as [Ngrok](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/) so that the Vonage platform can reach a locally running web server). For this blog post we're going to use Ngrok.

With those in place, let's get started.

## Scaffold a new Vue.JS Project

Run the following `vue` command in the terminal and pick the default of `(babel, eslint)` when prompted.

```
$ vue create call-from-browser

# navigate into the newly created Vue project folder
cd call-from-browser
```

This will result with you having the following directory structure and files:

```
call-from-browser
├── README.md
├── babel.config.js
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── index.html
├── src
│   ├── App.vue
│   ├── assets
│   │   └── logo.png
│   ├── components
│   │   └── HelloWorld.vue
│   └── main.js
└── yarn.lock
```

We're going to build a `CallFromBrowser` component so let's rename the default `HelloWorld` one that was created.

```sh
mv src/components/HelloWorld.vue src/components/CallFromBrowser.vue
```

With that we're ready to start building the UI.

## Create a Simple Phone Number Input & Dialing Interface

Vue.JS has a strong and growing ecosystem so it makes sense to utilize existing components if there are any. Luckily, there are a few options and we'll go with the [vue-tel-input component](https://github.com/EducationLink/vue-tel-input) by [Steven Dao](https://github.com/iamstevendao).

![vue-tel-input example animation](/content/blog/making-phone-calls-from-a-web-browser-with-vue-js-and-vonage/vue-tel-input.gif "vue-tel-input example animation")

Install the component:

```sh
$ yarn add vue-tel-input
```

Now that we have the component to help us validate phone numbers we can add it to the `CallFromBrowser` component. Open `src/components/CallFromBrowser.vue` in a code editor.

Update the `<template>` element as follows:

```xml
<template>
  <main class="call-from-browser">
    <vue-tel-input @onInput="onInput">
    </vue-tel-input>
    <button class="call-control" v-bind:class="{'call-in-progress': callInProgress}"
            v-on:click="controlCallClick"></button>
    
    <p>{{infoMessage}}</p>
  </main>
</template>
```

The template utilises the `<vue-tel-input>` component and sets an `@onInput` handler. We have a `<button>` that will have a `call-in-progress` class set based on a `callInProgress` property value and a click handler that will call a `controlCallClick` method. The template also has a `<p>{{infoMessage}}</p>` that enables us to provide some user feedback via a `data.infoMessage` property that we're just about to define.

Let's next update the contents of the `<script>` tag within the same file.

```xml
<script>
import 'vue-tel-input/dist/vue-tel-input.css'
import VueTelInput from 'vue-tel-input'

export default {
  name: 'CallFromBrowser',
  components: {
      'vue-tel-input': VueTelInput
  },

...
```

This imports the CSS and the component definition for the telephone input component sets the name of the component to `CallFromBrowser` and registers the `vue-tel-input` component dependency so it can be used within the template.

Next let's set up some properties for data binding such as the `callInProgress` property relied upon by the `template` and add any methods that are expected to be in place, as show, in the template:

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'CallFromBrowser',
  components: {
      'vue-tel-input': VueTelInput
  },
  
  data() {
    return {
      phone: {
        number: '',
        isValid: false,
        country: {}
      },
      infoMessage: "",
      callInProgress: false
    }
  },

  methods: {

    onInput({ number, isValid, country }) {
      this.phone.number = number;
      this.phone.isValid = isValid;
      this.phone.country = country;

      if(!isValid) {
        this.infoMessage = "Please enter a valid phone number"
      }
      else {
        this.infoMessage = `Thanks for entering a valid ${this.phone.country.name} phone number`
      }
    },

    controlCallClick() {
    }

  }
}
</script>
```

The `data` function returns a `phone` object that we populate in the `onInput` handler. In that handler, we set the phone number that the user has entered into the `vue-tel-input` component and properties representing the validity of the phone number and the country that the number is for.

We also provide the user with some feedback on the phone number validity by setting the `infoMessage` property. Vue data-binding means that the value we set here is reflected in the UI.

A stub `controlCallClick` method is also added to handle the `<button>` being clicked.

A final step in setting up the `CallFromBrowser` component is to add some styling. Replace the existing `<style>` element and contents with the following:

```xml
<style scoped>
.vue-tel-input {
  width: 200px;
  margin: auto;
}

.call-control {
  font-size: 11em; 
}

.call-control:before {
  content: '☎️';
}

.call-control.call-in-progress:before {
  content: '?'
}
</style>
```

The style sets the default `content` of the `<button>` to be the red telephone emoji (☎️). If the `call-in-progress` class is present, dynamically set if the `callInProgress` property returns `true` then the `content` will instead be an old-style phone handset emoji (?).

The final step in getting the basic UI in place is to update `App.vue` by replacing the `template` and `script` tags. Leave the `style` tag as-is.

```xml
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <CallFromBrowser/>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import CallFromBrowser from './components/CallFromBrowser.vue'

export default {
  name: 'app',
  components: {
    CallFromBrowser
  }
}
</script>
```

Replace `<template>` contents, import the `CallFromBrowser.vue` component definition and registering the imported component.

We can now run the app:

```shell
yarn serve
```

With this running, navigating in a browser to `http://localhost:8080` and trying out entering phone numbers into the `vue-input-tel` component. We'll see the phone number validated at the bottom of the app UI.

![Call from Browser simple user interface](/content/blog/making-phone-calls-from-a-web-browser-with-vue-js-and-vonage/call-from-browser-ui.png "Call from Browser simple user interface")

## Creating a User JWT to login to the Vonage Platform

The Vonage Stitch JavaScript SDK connects to the Vonage platform to enable In-App Voice functionality within the web browser. In order to connect to the Vonage platform, we need to `login` with a valid user authentication JWT (JSON Web Token) for the application user that defines that user's permissions. To create a User JWT we're going to need to create a few things:

1. a simple server that generates the User JWT that can be retrieved by the `CallFromBrowser` Vue.JS component
2. an Application within the Vonage platform - we can do this using the Vonage CLI
3. a User within the Application for the current web app users

Let's start by creating a simple server. Create a `server` directory, install a few dependencies and create an `index.js` and `.env` files for the functionality we need.

```sh
$ mkdir server
cd server
yarn init -yp #create package.json for server
yarn add express body-parser cors dotenv nexmo
touch index.js
touch .env # for environment variables
```

For the server, we're going to use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) with the CORS and body-parser middleware. [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) is used to load in the `.env` file which itself will contain configuration that we wouldn't want in source control. We've also installed the [Nexmo Node.JS library](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-node/) to help with User JWT generation.

Before we look at the server code let's also create the Application and the User for that application. We can do this using the Vonage CLI.

First, let's set up the Vonage CLI with your API Key and API Secret. Get your Vonage Developer API Key and API Secret from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings).

Run the following command in a terminal, while replacing api_key and api_secret with your own:

```shell
vonage config:set --apiKey=VONAGE_API_KEY --apiSecret=VONAGE_API_SECRET
```

Next, here is the command to create the Application:

```sh
$ vonage apps:create "call-from-browser" --voice_event_url=hhttps://example.com/event --voice_answer_url=https://example.com/answer
```

Running this command will output an application ID. It will also add the Application details to a `vonage_app.json` file. Take the application ID and add it to the `.env` file along with a variable for the `call-from-browser.key` location:

```
NEXMO_PRIVATE_KEY=call-from-browser.key
NEXMO_APP_ID=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID
```

The last piece of Application setup is to create a user within the application. It's possible to do this using Vonage libraries but in this case, we'll set up a user using the Vonage CLI:

```sh
$ vonage apps:users:create "demo"
```

This command will create the user for the application ID identified within the `.nexmo-app` file. Add an environment variable for the user name to the `.env` file.

```
NEXMO_PRIVATE_KEY=call-from-browser
NEXMO_APP_ID=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID
NEXMO_APP_USER_NAME=demo
```

Now open up `index.js` to add the basic server code:

```js
// Load .env config
require('dotenv').config({
    path: __dirname + '/.env'
});

const Nexmo = require('nexmo')
const express = require('express')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
const cors = require('cors')

const app = express()
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(cors())

// endpoint that doesn't authenticate the user
// it will simply return a JWT with every request
app.get('/no-auth', (req, res) => {
    res.json({userJwt: null})
})

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!'))
```

In the above code, we load in Express and set it up to parse inbound requests as JSON (we'll use this later). We also set Express up to support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This is required because the Vue.JS app is running on `localhost:8080` and the JavaScript code running in the browser needs to make a call to this server running on `localhost:3000`, a different port.

You can now run `node index.js` and then access `http://localhost:3000/no-auth` to ensure the endpoint returns the expected JSON.

![User JWT with null value](/content/blog/making-phone-calls-from-a-web-browser-with-vue-js-and-vonage/userjwt-null.png "User JWT with null value")

Now, let's add the code to generate the User JWT to be used with the Vonage Client SDK for JavaScript.

```js
const userAcl = {
    "paths": {
        "/v1/users/**": {},
        "/v1/conversations/**": {},
        "/v1/sessions/**": {},
        "/v1/knocking/**": {}
      }
}

// endpoint that doesn't authenticate the user
// it will simply return a JWT with every request
app.get('/no-auth', (req, res) => {
    const jwt = Nexmo.generateJwt(process.env.NEXMO_PRIVATE_KEY, {
        application_id: process.env.NEXMO_APP_ID,
        sub: process.env.NEXMO_APP_USER_NAME,
        exp: new Date().getTime() + 86400,
        acl: userAcl
    })

    res.json({userJwt: jwt})
})
```

The `userAcl` variables provide a set of claims or access rules that are used when creating the JWT along with the application ID, a `sub` for the name of the user and an `exp` as an expiry time for the JWT. See the [JWT and ACL overview](https://developer.vonage.com/conversation/guides/jwt-acl) in Vonage Developer for more information.

Restarting the node `index.js` processing and accessing `http://localhost:3000/no-auth` will show a real JWT having been generated.

![User JWT with real JWT value](/content/blog/making-phone-calls-from-a-web-browser-with-vue-js-and-vonage/userjwt.png "User JWT with real JWT value")

> Note: It can sometimes be handy to take a look at [JWT Debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) to check the contents of your JWT.

## Fetching the User JWT from the Web Browser

With the JWT generation in place, we can move back to the client to retrieve the User JWT that we create on the server.

Since it'd be bad practice to 100% hard code the server URL we'll make this settable via a Vue.JS property with a default that's handy for our development setup.

```js
    ...

      callInProgress: false
    }
  },

  props: {
    jwtUrl: {
      type: String,
      default: process.env.VUE_APP_JWT_URL || "http://localhost:3000/no-auth"
    }
  },
```

The `jwtUrl` value can then be overwritten by setting a `jwt-url` property on the `<CallFromBrowser>` element and the `default` can be changed when the component is built by having a `VUE_APP_JWT_URL` value set in a `.env` file in our top-level directory. For more info see [Vue.JS props](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html) and [Vue CLI 3 Environment Variables and Modes](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html).

With the server URL set, we can now `fetch` the User JWT. Vue.JS has various [life cycle hooks](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram). We'll retrieve the JWT within the `created` hook. To do this define a `created` function within the `CallFromBrowser` definition.

```js
  props: {
    jwtUrl: {
      type: String,
      default: process.env.VUE_APP_JWT_URL || "http://localhost:3000/no-auth"
    }
  },

  created() {
    fetch(this.$props.jwtUrl)
      .then(response => {
        return response.json();
      })
      .then(json => {
          console.log(json)
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error(error)
      })
  },
```

Ensure your Vue.JS development server is still running (run `yarn serve` from within the `call-from-browser` directory if not) navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and open up your developer tools to check the console and make sure the User JWT us logged.

![JWT now present in browser and output via console.log](/content/blog/making-phone-calls-from-a-web-browser-with-vue-js-and-vonage/jwt-in-browser.png "JWT now present in browser and output via console.log")

## Adding the Vonage Client SDK for JavaScript

With the User JWT in the client we can move to include the Vonage Client SDK for JavaScript:

```sh
cd .. # navigate up from the 'server' directory
yarn add nexmo-stitch
```

Next, include the SDK within the `CallFromBrowser.vue` component and import the `ConversationClient` object definition:

```xml
<script>
import 'vue-tel-input/dist/vue-tel-input.css'
import VueTelInput from 'vue-tel-input'

import ConversationClient from 'nexmo-stitch'
```

Once we have the required definition included we need to create a new instance of the `ConversationClient` and `login`. We'll do this after retrieving the User JWT:

```js
  created() {
    fetch(this.$props.jwtUrl)
      .then(response => {
        return response.json();
      })
      .then(json => {
        this.conversationClient = new ConversationClient({debug: true})

        return this.conversationClient.login(json.userJwt)
      })
      .then(app => {
        this.app = app

        // When the active member (the user) makes a call
        // keep a reference to the Call object so we can
        // hang up later
        this.app.on("member:call", (member, call) => {
            this.call = call
        });

        // Keep track of call status so we know how to
        // interact with the call e.g. hangup
        this.app.on("call:status:changed", (call) => {
          this.callInProgress =
            [
              "machine",
              "timeout",
              "unanswered",
              "rejected",
              "busy",
              "failed",
              "completed"
            ].indexOf(call.status) === -1;
        })
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error)
    })
  },
```

After the login Promise resolves we receive a reference to a representation of the Application via the `app` variable. We keep a reference of that app for future use (`this.app`) and also bind to two events on the app.

We bind to `member:call` which is triggered when the active user makes a call. In the event handler we store a reference to the current call with `this.call`.

We also bind to `call:status:changed` to keep track of the [call status](https://developer.nexmo.com/stitch/in-app-voice/call-statuses). Within the event handler we updated the `callInProgress` property based on the call status. If the call is in any of the final states then the call is not in progress. Otherwise, the call status is in progress. These states will be reflected in the `<button>` in the template.

## Making a Phone Call from the Web Browser

The final thing we need to do in the client - before we make one last update to the server and complete the app - is handling the user click on the `<button>`.

```js
        ...
    },

    controlCallClick() {
      if(this.callInProgress) {
        this.call.hangUp()
      }
      else if(this.phone.isValid) {
        this.app.callPhone(this.phone.number)
      }
    }
```

Above we've updated `controlCallClick` with the logic to check if there is no call in progress and the user has entered a valid phone number this should trigger the call. If there is an active call this should hang up the call. In both cases we call the appropriate function on the `this.call` reference that was set in the `member:call` event handler.

With all the client-side functionality in place, you can enter a valid phone number, click the call button and you'll then see an error in the console that comes from the Vonage platform

> conversation:error:not-found

![conversation-not-found message in browser console](/content/blog/making-phone-calls-from-a-web-browser-with-vue-js-and-vonage/conversation-not-found.png "conversation-not-found message in browser console")

When a call is initiated or received by the Vonage platform it makes an HTTP request to an `answer_url` for the relevant associated Vonage application. The server that receives that HTTP request must return a Vonage Conversation Control Object (NCCO); a set of instructions informing Vonage how to proceed with the call.

## Connecting the Browser to a Phone

Back in `server/index.js` add an `/answer` endpoint to handle the `GET` request from the Vonage platform:

```js
app.get('/answer', (req, res) => {
    const ncco = [{
        "action": "connect",
        "from": process.env.NEXMO_FROM_NUMBER,
        "endpoint": [{
            "type": "phone",
            "number": req.query.to
        }]
    }]

    res.json(ncco)
})
```

Vonage expects a JSON structure, the NCCO, to be returned instructing it how to proceed with the call. The above `ncco` JSON structure that we return informs Vonage to `connect` the call to a `phone` endpoint with the number identified by the value in `req.query.to` - the `to` query parameter in the inbound GET request. This number is the number we passed to `this.app.callPhone` in our Vue.JS app.

_Notes:

1. Please remember that we have no application-level authentication in our web app so you'll need to add this yourself e.g. within the answer URL endpoint you can check the `req.query.to` and `req.query.from` to ensure that the user (identified by `from`) is allowed to make the requested call.
2. If you have a Vonage virtual phone number you should add a `NEXMO_FROM_NUMBER` entry to the `.env` file so that recipient of phone calls see a number on their inbound call. Otherwise, it may come up as a "Private Number" or "Unknown"._

Restart the Node process for the server so it's running with the updated code.

Finally, we need to make it possible for the Vonage platform to reach the answer URL. To do this use Ngrok to create a local tunnel to `localhost:3000`.

```sh
$ ngrok http 3000
```

![Ngrok output in a terminal](/content/blog/making-phone-calls-from-a-web-browser-with-vue-js-and-vonage/ngrok.png "Ngrok output in a terminal")

And update the `answer_url` for your Vonage Application to utilise the Ngrok tunnel URLs using the Vonage CLI.

```sh
$ vonage apps:update VONAGE_APP_ID --voice_answer_url=https://4ca73ac6.ngrok.io/answer --voice_event_url=https://4ca73ac6.ngrok.io/event
```

*Note: you can find the `VONAGE_APP_ID` in `server/.env` or `server/vonage_app.json`*

Head back into the Vue.JS app in the browser, enter a phone number and click the button to make an outbound call from your web browser.

## Conclusion

The purpose of this blog post is was to show how to to build an app that enables a user to call any phone on the planet directly from a web browser using Vue.JS and In-App Voice using the Vonage Client SDK for JavaScript. It provides the basics and has hopefully provided inspiration for what use cases this can enable. Oh, and you could also update the app to [support inbound phone calls](https://developer.nexmo.com/stitch/in-app-voice/inbound-pstn).

As mentioned at the start of this post, In-App Voice is in Developer Preview so please let us know if you've any thoughts on the experience you've had whilst building this app or if you have any other feedback by joining the [Vonage Community Slack](https://developer.nexmo.com/community/slack).
