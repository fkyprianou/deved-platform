*This is the third tutorial on how to use Voice APIs with ASP.NET series.* 

In previous tutorials, we learned [how to make a Text-to-Speech phone call with ASP.NET](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/28/text-to-speech-phone-call-dr/) and [how to Play Audio to a Caller in ASP.NET Core](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/11/29/how-to-play-audio-to-a-caller-in-asp-net-core-dr/). But how about receiving calls? The good news is the Nexmo Voice API handles inbound calls as well. 

Inbound calls are calls made to a Nexmo number from another regular phone anywhere in the world. Both inbound and outbound calls follow the same call flow once answered. This [call flow](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/guides/call-flow) is controlled by [an NCCO](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference). 

In this tutorial, we will create an ASP.NET app that handles inbound voice calls and returns a dynamic response.

## Learning objectives

In this tutorial, we will: 

* Create an ASP.NET Core app. 
* Use NancyFX with ASP.NET Core. 
* Create a Nexmo voice application. 
* Receive inbound calls within the app. 
* Create and return an NCCO. 
* Run and test the code using Ngrok.

## Prerequisite

* Visual Studio 2017. 
* A project setup for this tutorial series, which you can find on [Github](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-dotnet-quickstart/tree/ASPNET/NexmoVoiceASPNetCoreQuickStarts). 
* Optional: [The Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli).

## Configuration

To use [The Nexmo Voice API](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/overview), we need to create [a voice application](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/applications). 

The configuration steps are detailed in [the "Nexmo Voice API with ASP.NET: Before you start" post](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/28/nexmo-voice-api-asp-net-configure-dr/). 

Once the application is configured successfully, we are ready to receive an inbound call with The Nexmo Voice API!

## Receiving a phone call with ASP.NET

When a call is received, the Nexmo Voice API will make a request to the application to figure out how to respond to the caller. 

To achieve this, we are going to use NancyFX along side our ASP.NET Core project. 

[Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy) is a lightweight open source framework that promotes the "super-duper-happy-path". This means that it has sensible defaults and conventions and tries to stay our of our way as much as possible. 

First of all, we need to add Nancy to our project : 

`csharp PM> Install-Package Nancy PM> Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Owin` 

To allow Nancy to handle any HTTP requests, we need to tell ASP.NET Core to use Nancy via `Owin` in the `Configure` method of `Startup.cs`. 

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Nancy.Owin;

namespace NexmoVoiceASPNetCoreQuickStarts
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
        {
            app.UseOwin(x => x.UseNancy());
        }
    }
}
```

We are all good to go! The next step is to create a Nancy module to handle any requests to `/webhook/answer`. 

```csharp
using Nancy;

namespace NexmoVoiceASPNetCoreQuickStarts
{
    public class VoiceModule : NancyModule
    {
        public VoiceModule()
        {
            Get["/webhook/answer"] = x => "Hello happy path";
        }
    }
}
```

I'm using Postman to test, and as you can see our `/webhook/answer` route is returning exactly what's expected. 

![asp postman screenshot](/content/blog/receive-a-phone-call-with-nexmo-voice-api-asp-net-core-and-nancyfx/asp-post-webhook-answer-1-.png "asp-post")

This is a great start, but Nexmo doesn't know what to do with that string. To properly respond to the call, we need to return an NCCO. 

```csharp
using Nancy;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

namespace NexmoVoiceASPNetCoreQuickStarts
{
    public class VoiceModule : NancyModule
    {
        public VoiceModule()
        {
            Get["/webhook/answer"] = x => GetInboundNCCO();
        }

        private string GetInboundNCCO()
        {
            dynamic TalkNCCO = new JObject();
            TalkNCCO.action = "talk";
            TalkNCCO.text = "Thank you for calling from " + string.Join(' ', this.Request.Query["from"].ToString().ToCharArray()));
            TalkNCCO.voiceName = "Kimberly";
            
            JArray jarrayObj = new JArray();
            jarrayObj.Add(TalkNCCO);

            return jarrayObj.ToString();

        }
    }
}
```

`GetInboundNCCO()` will create an NCCO object that will use Text-To-Speech to read the callerâ€™s phone number back to them using the `talk` action within the NCCO. 

We are accessing the phone number via the `from` param in the request.

![webhook answer screenshot](/content/blog/receive-a-phone-call-with-nexmo-voice-api-asp-net-core-and-nancyfx/webhook-answer_li.jpeg "webhook answer")

That's all the code we need. To test this properly, some more configuration steps are required. 

If you've been following up so far, you've already configured your Nexmo account and created a voice app as shown in [this post](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/28/nexmo-voice-api-asp-net-configure-dr/). 

We need to link this app to a Nexmo phone number, the number we will be calling. If you don't have a number, you can purchase one using the dashboard or the CLI. `javascript nexmo number:buy --country_code US` Similarly to link the number, you can use the dashboard or the CLI. 

```javascript
nexmo number:buy --country_code US
```

Similarly to link the number, you can use the dashboard or the CLI.

```javascript
nexmo link:app NEXMO_PHONE_NUMBER  NEXMO_APP_ID
```

We need to tell Nexmo which URL to make a request to when a call is received (`answer_url`). For me, this url is <http://localhost:63286/webhook/answer> and that's only running locally. 

To expose our `answer_url`, we will use our good friend [Ngrok](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/). 

```csharp
ngrok http 63286 -host-header="localhost:63286"
```

This will return a new URL (mine is `http://5e18af56.ngrok.io`) that can be used as the `answer_url` for the voice application. Update your `answer_url` to `http://[id].ngrok.io/webhook/answer` 

Tada! Run the app and give it a go by calling the Nexmo number you purchased. It should thank you for calling, then read out your phone number.
