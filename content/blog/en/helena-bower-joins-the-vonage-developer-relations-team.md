Hello! My name is Helena and I am absolutely thrilled to have joined Vonage as a Technical Writer.

My interest in tech started like many others in the world of gaming; I slowly but surely started to wonder how a computer *actually* works and eventually decided to study Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. During my time there I studied lots of different topics such as Cyber Security, programming (of course), and AI / Machine Learning. 

Along the way I completed a few internships, including a year in industry at BT Security where I was lucky enough to join the graduate scheme in 2019. Working in business improvement, I looked at all sorts of transformation projects for the systems used to provide security services to customers. After nearly 3 years at BT I decided that I wanted to change lanes and came across the Technical Writer position at Vonage; fast forward a few months and here I am!

When I’m not busy writing documentation, I can often be found working on one of my proudest achievements: HackTheMidlands. A hackathon based in Birmingham, HackTheMidlands is open to anyone over the age of 14, where attendees are invited to learn, build and share while designing and developing a piece of technology over a 24 hour period. It’s a lot of fun so if you’re reading this keep an eye out for updates!

Outside of all of that, I go to quite a few shows at the theatre (some say too many, I say not enough), play video and board games, love baking, and have a rapidly growing vinyl record collection.

Like I said before, I am so excited to be part of the team here at Vonage and am looking forward to the adventure that awaits!
