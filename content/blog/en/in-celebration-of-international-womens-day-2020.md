## London Breakfast Meeting

On March 3rd, the DevRel team hosted over 50 people to attend talks by internal and external speakers where they spoke about their careers, their role models and other topics they’re passionate about. Speakers included [Melinda Seckington](https://twitter.com/mseckington), [Dr Sarah Wiseman](https://twitter.com/oopsohno), and [Jessica Rose](https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose). And, our very own Marie Laurendeau, Acacia De Almeida and Hui Jing Chen.

Melinda took us on a journey of her career in tech. It involved everything from studying at university (and how this led her to her current role), to writing a movie blog, winning hackathons, and organising tech events in London.

Dr Sarah Wiseman spoke about research she has undertaken throughout her career with topics spanning from how people use emoji to communicate to create an immersive theatre experience.

Jessica Rose focused on the topic of imposter syndrome and provided tips on how to mitigate it.

Marie’s talk touched upon the topic of balancing career with family life. She mentioned working with female leaders in her previous job in France and how they became her role models. She also mentioned how supported she’s felt at Vonage with taking time off for her growing family while progressing in her role.

Acacia talked about her journey to becoming part of the TokBox family and how she grabbed the opportunity to take on a new challenge and move to London to join the Vonage API Group Product team.

Hui Jing joined over video from Singapore. She shared stories centred around women-led and women-inclusive initiatives from local communities that she is involved with.

## Tel Aviv Breakfast Meeting

On March 8th, the Tel Aviv office hosted more than 50 people to attend talks by Adi Altschuler who formerly led Google for Education (Israel) where she would advise teachers on the use of I.T. with the goal of transforming Israel's education system. Adi left Google to found Inclu – Special for All that promotes inclusive education in Israel through a network of public inclusive schools.

It was inspiring to hear about her initiatives focused on inclusion. She spoke about Krembo Wings which provides weekly social activities for youth with different types of disabilities and their able-bodied peers. Zikaron Basalon is another of Adi’s organization which supports active Holocaust remembrance and commemoration by small groups. The organization now numbers in the 10s of thousands. 

Adi really touched the hearts of employees with her lessons of building inclusive communities, especially in schools.

## Each for Equal

The International Women's Day campaign theme is #EachforEqual for 2020. #EachforEqual is a call to action, to motivate everyone in support of celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.

We encouraged colleagues around the world to strike the #EachforEqual pose, and snap a picture to share. Across Vonage we had hundreds of individuals take part and share their pictures.

## Dress for Success

Several office locations hosted a clothing drive for Dress for Success, to benefit women who may have been affected by domestic violence or socio-economic challenges by providing gently used business attire, removing a common barrier to success and fostering confidence and empowerment as they begin interviewing.

## Other International Events

Vonage CEO Alan Masarek shared his thoughts on International Women’s Day to the entire company, and about how important inclusion was towards our goal of becoming a destination place to work. We also hosted a live-stream with Kristy Fall of Rutgers, who shared her experience in entrepreneurship and provided advice on leadership across different industries.

Each office has a dedication board where colleagues could write messages and dedications and pin them to board.

The Holmdel office held a meetup and invited colleagues to make dedications and share their views on inclusion.

Our other UK office based in Basingstoke held a breakfast and Food for Thought interactive workshop session where colleagues shared thoughts on inclusion.

Our Wroclaw, Poland and Munich, Germany offices both held breakfast events and workshops with office leadership giving closing talks.

## In Closing

We are proud to be elevating voices within the Vonage community this International Women's Day. Thank you to all who supported our various initiatives and helped shine a light on issues women and non-binary folks face in the software industry.
