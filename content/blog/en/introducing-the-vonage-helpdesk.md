The biggest shift that we are seeing in web applications is the requirement for multi-channel communications. It isn't enough anymore for your e-commerce site to have _just_ a "Contact Us" page, where you can email while also having a popup semi-instant messager like Hotjar. Now, you can choose to be ahead of the curve by changing or promoting the medium by which you communicate with customers; an example being that an email conversation can be switched to a live WhatsApp chat, or automated voice call queues that connect with real (human) agents.

It's time we demonstrated how these channels work, so without further ado (for my PHP developers), I would like to introduce *The Vonage Helpdesk*. In this article I'll show you how to fire it up locally and then dig into how the SMS aspect of the app works to start us off.

### What is the Vonage Helpdesk?

Some time ago, we had a concept web application called Deskmo. This is a new reinterpretation of that: a web application that will slowly be built over time to include best practises for working with Vonage APIs and demonstrations of modern PHP code.

### What is it written in?

Vonage Helpdesk is a PHP web application built in Laravel 9. It uses Laravel's Sail for portability, so you have a fully Dockerized app (goodbye, system-level dependencies!) that uses MySQL as the database.

### Installing

#### Requirements

Due to the application using Docker, the requirements are somewhat reduced. You'll need:

* A Windows, Linux, or Mac machine that can run Docker v20+ (the current version)
* PHP8.0+
* Composer
* Git installed

First up, we need to download the repository. Type the following into the command line:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Vonage-Community/sample-messages_voice-php-helpdesk.git
```

Now, we should have the application in a new folder. Next up, we install the PHP dependencies. Do this by navigating into the folder (i.e. `sample-messages_voice-php-helpdesk`) and running Composer:

```bash
composer install
```
Laravel Sail should have been pulled into the `vendor` folder, so providing you have Docker installed, you can run the following command to boot up the application:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

### Coming Next...

Aha! We're not done yet by a country mile! Keep an eye out for more articles in the series as we add to the app, including Voice capabilities using Deepgram, realtime updates using Laravel Livewire, and building out the test suite with PEST.
