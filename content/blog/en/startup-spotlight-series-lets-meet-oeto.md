The internet is overflowing with information, but information is not knowledge. Expert marketplaces bring together the right people at the right time – patients and doctors, marketers or engineers and startup founders, tutors and students – the list can go on and on. Event though expert networks were not immune from the effects of Covid-19, the market continued to grow double-digits in 2020, bringing the total industry size to over $1.5 billion, according to an analysis released by Integrity Research and Inex One.

As expert marketplaces are popping up right and left, Oeto wants to inspire and help businesses launch their own marketplaces for various niches and local ecosystems. This week we caught up with Piia Sander, the CEO of Oeto, to find out more about how the expert network industry is the next big thing and what's her vision for Oeto.

Enjoy the interview!

## In one sentence, what does Oeto do?

Oeto provides companies with easy to use workflow automation tools to bring their experts online.

## What is the problem you are solving? Was this the initial problem or did you pivot?

This is the initial problem and we are helping to give companies tools to better manage and monetize their experts time.

## What differentiates Oeto from your competitors? Is there a secret sauce?

While companies offering similar tools have focused on the freelancer market, we are focusing on existing businesses with an expert or a mentor pool. We pride ourselves in the best possible customer service and easy to use tools. 

## VC, Angel, Bootstrap or Other?

Angel and looking to fundraise.

## What’s the biggest challenge you faced and how did you overcome it?

Time. We started with all the team members working on Oeto as a side-hustle. I only recently joined full-time and we are working on getting other existing and new team members to join full-time as well.

## The biggest mistake Oeto has made so far and what did you learn from it?

Oeto had a few other team members in the first few months and we learned how important open and honest communication is between the founding team. These issues have now been solved.

## You can choose one to be on your board: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Who do you choose and why? 

Bill Gates. He leaves the impression of being a down to earth person, while being one of the most successful businessmen of all time. There is great value in being humble and powerful at the same time.

## What progress have you made since launching? 

We have validated the business model, launched the MVP and are now onboarding our first clients. 

## What’s next for Oeto? Where do you want to be in 3 years?

In 3 years we want to be the go-to tool for expert workflow management. The dream is to help companies help people better manage their time and workload. Things changed for all of us in 2020 and work will never again be the same. We need new tools for a new way of working.
