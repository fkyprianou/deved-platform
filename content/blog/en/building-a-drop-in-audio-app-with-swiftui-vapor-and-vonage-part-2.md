## Introduction

The [first part](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2021/03/02/building-a-drop-in-audio-app-with-swiftui-vapor-and-vonage-part-1/) of this tutorial used the [Conversation API](https://developer.nexmo.com/conversation/overview) to create a server for a drop-in audio app. The server supports creating new users, creating new chat rooms, and listing all the open chat rooms. In this tutorial, you will build an iOS application that uses the Vonage Client SDK to consume and start chatting. 
If you like to jump straight into this tutorial, you can follow the instructions in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nexmo-community/swift-vapor-drop-in-audio) for the server to get everything set up.

## Prerequisites

Additionally, from the first part's prerequisites, you will need [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) to install the Vonage Client SDK for iOS.

## Creating the iOS Application

Time to get the iOS application set up. Once it is created, you will install the Client SDK and ask for microphone permissions.

### Create an Xcode Project

To get started, open Xcode and create a new project by going to *File* > *New* > *Project*. Select an *App template* and give it a name. Select SwiftUI for the *interface*, SwiftUI App for the *life cycle*, and Swift for the *language*. Finally, a location to save your project. 

![Xcode project creation](/content/blog/building-a-drop-in-audio-app-with-swiftui-and-vapor-part-2/xcodeproject.png)

### Install the Client SDK

Now that you've created the project, you can add the Vonage Client SDK as a dependency. Navigate to the location where you saved the project in your terminal and run the following commands.

1. Run the `pod init` command to create a new Podfile for your project.
2. Open the Podfile in Xcode using `open -a Xcode Podfile`.
3. Update the Podfile to have `NexmoClient` as a dependency. 

```ruby
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'SwiftUIDropin' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for SwiftUIDropin
  pod 'NexmoClient'
end
```

4. Install the SDK using `pod install`.
5. Open the new *xcworkspace* file in Xcode using `open SwiftUIDropin.xcworkspace`.

### Microphone Permissions

Since the application will be using the microphone to place calls, you need to ask for permission to do so explicitly.

The first step is to edit the `Info.plist` file. The `Info.plist` is a file that contains all the metadata required for the application. Add a new entry to the file by hovering your mouse over the last entry in the list and click the little `+` button that appears. From the dropdown list, pick `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` and add `Microphone access required to take part in audio rooms` for its value.

You will do the second step for requesting microphone permissions later on in the tutorial.

## Create the Login Screen

The Client SDK needs a JWT to connect to the Vonage servers. The iOS application needs to send a username to the `/auth` endpoint of the server. Create a new file called `Models.swift` by going to *File > New > File* (CMD + N). Similar to the backend, there is a struct for the request's body and a struct for server response.

Add the following structs to the `Models.swift` file:

```swift
struct Auth: Codable {
    struct Body: Codable {
        let name: String
    }
    
    struct Response: Codable {
        let name: String
        let jwt: String
    }
}
```

Since the iOS application will use three different endpoints, you will create a small class to reuse the networking code. Create a new file called `RemoteLoader.swift` and add the following class:

```swift
import Foundation

final class RemoteLoader {
    enum RemoteLoaderError: Error {
        case url
        case data
    }
    
    static func load<T: Codable, U: Codable>(urlString: String, body: T?, responseType: U.Type, completion: @escaping ((Result<U, RemoteLoaderError>) -> Void)) {
        guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {
            completion(.failure(.url))
            return
        }
        
        var request = URLRequest(url: url)
        
        if let body = body, let encodedBody = try? JSONEncoder().encode(body) {
            request.httpMethod = "POST"
            request.httpBody = encodedBody
            request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        }
        
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
            if let data = data {
                if let response = try? JSONDecoder().decode(U.self, from: data) {
                    completion(.success(response))
                    return
                }
            }
            completion(.failure(.data))
        }.resume()
    }
}
```

The `RemoteLoader` class consists of an error enum and a static `load` function. The load function is generic over two types, `T` and `U`, which conform to the `Codeable` protocol.

`T` represents the struct that will be used as the body of a request that this function sends. It is optional as some requests may not require a body. `U` represents the type of response struct.

When making a network request, you supply the URL, body, and response type, and the `load` function returns a result. 

Before you start building the user interface (UI) for the app, you will build a model class first. This class is used to separate the logic of the app from the view code. In this case, the model class will handle the Client SDK delegate calls and make the login network request.

At the top of the `ContentView.swift` file, import the Client SDK and AVFoundation:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import NexmoClient
import AVFoundation
```

Then at the bottom of the file, create a new class called `AuthModel`.

```swift
final class AuthModel: NSObject, ObservableObject, NXMClientDelegate {

}
```

Within this class, define the properties needed:

```swift
final class AuthModel: NSObject, ObservableObject, NXMClientDelegate {
    @Published var loading = false
    @Published var connected = false
    
    var name = ""
    
    private let audioSession = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
}
```

The `@Published` property wrapper is how the UI will know when to react to changes from the model class; this is all handled for you as the class conforms to the `ObservedObject` protocol.

The `audioSession` property is used to request the microphone permissions. To complete requesting microphone permissions for the app, add the following function to the `AuthModel` class:

```swift
func requestPermissionsIfNeeded() {
    if audioSession.recordPermission != .granted {
        audioSession.requestRecordPermission { (isGranted) in
            print("Microphone permissions \(isGranted)")
        }
    }
}
```

This function will first check if the permissions have already been granted; if not, it will request them and print the outcome to the console.
Next, you can add the function that makes the request to the backend server using the `RemoteLoader` class:

```swift
func login() {
    loading = true
    
    RemoteLoader.load(urlString: "https://URL.ngrok.io/auth", body: Auth.Body(name: self.name), responseType: Auth.Response.self) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let response):
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                NXMClient.shared.setDelegate(self)
                NXMClient.shared.login(withAuthToken: response.jwt)
            }
        default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```

Replace the `urlString` string with your ngrok URL. Once the response is received, the function will use the JWT to log in to the Client SDK and set the SDK's delegate to this class.
In a production environment, you would want to have the server also pass along information about the TTL of the JWT and perform further checks in the application about the validity of the JWT before performing actions that require the Client SDK. 

The `NXMClientDelegate` is how the Client SDK communicates changes with the Vonage servers back to your application. Next, implement the required delegate functions in the `AuthModel` class:

```swift
func client(_ client: NXMClient, didChange status: NXMConnectionStatus, reason: NXMConnectionStatusReason) {
    switch status {
    case .connected:
        self.connected = true
        self.loading = false
    default:
        self.connected = false
        self.loading = false
    }
}

func client(_ client: NXMClient, didReceiveError error: Error) {
    self.loading = false
    self.connected = false
}
```

When there is a change in the SDK's status or an error, the booleans `connected` and `loading` will change, which will cause changes to the UI. The final function that you need to add to the `AuthModel` calls `requestPermissionsIfNeeded`: 

```swift
func setup() {
    requestPermissionsIfNeeded()
}
```

With the model class complete, you can now create the UI. Update the `ContentView` struct:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var authModel = AuthModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                if authModel.loading {
                    ProgressView()
                    Text("Loading").padding(20)
                } else {
                    TextField("Name", text: $authModel.name)
                        .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
                        .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                        .padding(20)
                    Button("Log in") {
                        authModel.login()
                    }
                    NavigationLink("", destination: RoomListView(),
                                   isActive: $authModel.connected).hidden()
                    
                }
            }.navigationTitle("VonageHouse 👋")
            .navigationBarBackButtonHidden(true)
        }.onAppear(perform: authModel.setup)
    }
}
```

The `ContentView` struct has an instance of the `AuthModel` class. The loading property of the `authModel` will determine if the `ContentView` renders a loading state or the input view, which has a `Textfield` for a username to be entered and a button that triggers the `login` function from earlier. 

The input view also has a hidden `NavigationLink` that will push the next view, `RoomListView`, when the Client SDK successfully connects. If you comment out the `NavigationLink` line and run the project (CMD + R), you will see the login screen:

![Two screenshots, the first the iOS app requesting permissions, the second the login screen.](/content/blog/building-a-drop-in-audio-app-with-swiftui-and-vapor-part-2/screenshot-2021-02-12-at-14.14.15.png)

## Create the Room List Screen

When the Client SDK connects successfully, you would want to request the backend server to get a list of all the open rooms. Similarly to the login screen, you will want to add the model structs then build a model class to handle the logic. Add the structs to the `Models.swift` file:

```swift
struct RoomResponse: Codable {
    let id: String
    let displayName: String
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case displayName = "display_name"
    }
}

struct CreateRoom: Codable {
    struct Body: Codable {
        let displayName: String
        
        enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
            case displayName = "display_name"
        }
    }
    
    struct Response: Codable {
        let id: String
    }
}
```

Create a new file called `RoomListView.swift` and add the model class:

```swift
import SwiftUI

final class RoomModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var results = [RoomResponse]()
    @Published var loading = false
    @Published var showingCreateModal = false
    @Published var hasConv = false
    
    var convID: String? = nil
    var roomName: String = ""
    
    func loadRooms() {
        RemoteLoader.load(urlString: "https://URL.ngrok.io/rooms", body: Optional<String>.none, responseType: [RoomResponse].self) { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let response):
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.results = response
                }
            default:
                break
            }
        }
    }
    
    func createRoom() {
        RemoteLoader.load(urlString: "https://URL.ngrok.io/rooms", body: CreateRoom.Body(displayName: self.roomName), responseType: CreateRoom.Response.self) { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let response):
                self.convID = response.id
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.hasConv = true
                    self.loading = false
                    self.showingCreateModal = false
                }
            default:
                break
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This model class handles loading the list of rooms and sending the request to create a new room; replace the `urlString` string with your URL from ngrok. The UI will observe the `results` property.

Next, create the UI that will observe this model class. Add the `RoomListView` struct to the same file:

```swift
struct RoomListView: View {
    @ObservedObject var roomModel = RoomModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            List(roomModel.results, id: \.id) { item in
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    NavigationLink(destination: RoomView(convID: item.id, convName: item.displayName)) {
                        Text(item.displayName)
                    }
                }
            }.onAppear(perform: roomModel.loadRooms)
            Button("Create room") {
                roomModel.showingCreateModal.toggle()
            }
            NavigationLink("", destination: RoomView(convID: roomModel.convID ?? "", convName: roomModel.roomName),
                           isActive: $roomModel.hasConv).hidden()
        }
        .navigationTitle("VonageCottage 👋")
        .navigationBarBackButtonHidden(true)
        .navigationBarItems(trailing:
                                Button("Refresh") {
                                    roomModel.loadRooms()
                                }
        )
        .sheet(isPresented: $roomModel.showingCreateModal, content: {
            CreateRoomModal(roomModel: roomModel)
        })
    }
}
```

The `RoomListView` struct has a `List` component that will display the list of open rooms and a refresh button in the navigation bar. There is also a `Button` component, which toggles a boolean that shows a `CreateRoomModal` view. Add the view to the same file:

```swift
struct CreateRoomModal: View {
    @ObservedObject var roomModel: RoomModel
    
    var body: some View {
        if !roomModel.loading {
            VStack {
                TextField("Enter the room name", text: $roomModel.roomName)
                    .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                    .padding(20)
                Button("Create room") {
                    roomModel.loading = true
                    roomModel.createRoom()
                }
            }
        } else {
            ProgressView()
        }
    }
}
```

This view consists of a `TextField` for room name entry, a loading state, and a `Button` to trigger the create room function on the `RoomModel` class. The two `NavigationLink` components in the `RoomListView` reference a `RoomView`. The `RoomView` takes a conversation ID as a parameter that the Client SDK needs to load the conversation.

## Create the Room Screen

This final screen is where users of your application will join conversations and talk to each other. Much like the previous screens, you will start by adding a model struct to the `Models.swift` file:

```swift
struct Member: Hashable {
    let id: String
    let name: String
}
```

This struct will represent how a member of a room is displayed in the UI. Next, create a new file called `RoomView.swift`, and within that file, create a `ConversationModel` class:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import NexmoClient

final class ConversationModel: NSObject, ObservableObject, NXMConversationDelegate {
    @Published var loading = false
    @Published var members = [Member]()
    
    private var conversation: NXMConversation?
    private let currentUsername: String? = NXMClient.shared.user?.name
        
    func memberFrom(_ event: NXMMemberEvent) -> Member {
        return Member(id: event.fromMemberId, name: event.embeddedInfo?.user.name ?? "")
    }

    func memberFrom(_ nxmMemberSummary: NXMMemberSummary) -> Member {
         return Member(id: nxmMemberSummary.memberUuid, name: nxmMemberSummary.user.name)
     }
    
    func conversation(_ conversation: NXMConversation, didReceive event: NXMMemberEvent) {
        let member = memberFrom(event)
        switch event.state {
        case .joined:
            guard !self.members.contains(member),
                  self.currentUsername != member.name else { break }
            self.members.append(member)
        case .left:
            guard self.members.contains(member),
                  let memberIndex = self.members.firstIndex(of: member) else { break }
            self.members.remove(at: memberIndex)
        default:
            break
        }
    }
    
    func conversation(_ conversation: NXMConversation, didReceive error: Error) {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

The `ConversationModel` class conforms to `NXMConversationDelegate` in addition to the `ObservableObject` protocol like the other model classes. The two functions from the `NXMConversationDelegate` that you will be using are `didReceive:event` and `didReceive:error`.  

The `didReceive:event` function is how the iOS application will be notified of users leaving and joining the conversation. When this happens, members are added and removed from the `members` array, which the UI observes.  

Now you can add the functions that handle loading and leaving conversations to the `ConversationModel` class:

```swift
final class ConversationModel: NSObject, ObservableObject, NXMConversationDelegate {
    ...
    func loadConversation(convID: String) {
        guard conversation == nil else { return }
        
        loading = true
        NXMClient.shared.getConversationWithUuid(convID) { error, conversation in
            self.conversation = conversation
            self.conversation?.delegate = self

            self.conversation?.join { [weak self] error, memberId in
                guard let self = self else { return }
                self.conversation?.getMembersPage(withPageSize: 100, order: .asc) { error, membersPage in
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        guard let membersPage = membersPage else { return }
                        self.members = membersPage.memberSummaries.map { self.memberFrom($0) }

                        if !self.members.contains(where: { $0.name == self.currentUsername }) {
                            if let id = memberId, let name = self.currentUsername {
                                self.members.append(Member(id: id, name: name))
                            }
                        }
                        self.loading = false
                    }
                    
                    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
                        self.conversation?.enableMedia()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    func leaveConversation(completion: () -> Void) {
        self.conversation?.disableMedia()
        self.conversation?.leave(nil)
        completion()
    }
    ...
}
```

The `loadConversation` function calls `getConversationWithUuid` on the Client SDK, returning the conversation object stored in a local property.
Now that you have the conversation object, you can join the conversation. Once that is complete, you can enable media for the user, allowing them to speak and hear other users in the conversation.
`leaveConversation` does the opposite. It disables media, leaves the conversation, and calls a completion handler passed to the function.  

The UI for this screen is split into two structs, a smaller view for a single member and a bigger view with a grid of members and handles navigation. Create the `MemberView` struct in the same file:

```swift
struct MemberView: View {
    var memberName: String
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(Color.gray)
                .frame(width: 75, height: 75)
            Text(memberName)
        }
    }
}
```

This is a circle with `Text` component beneath for the room member's name. Next add the `RoomView`:

```swift
struct RoomView: View {
    @StateObject var conversationModel = ConversationModel()
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode
    
    var convID: String
    var convName: String
    
    let columns = [
        GridItem(.flexible()),
        GridItem(.flexible()),
        GridItem(.flexible())
    ]
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {

                            }
                        }
                    }
                    Button("Leave room") {
                        conversationModel.leaveConversation(completion: { presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss() })
                    }
                }
            }
        }.navigationTitle(convName)
        .navigationBarBackButtonHidden(true)
        .onAppear(perform: {
            conversationModel.loadConversation(convID: convID)
        })
    }
}
```

This view has a `presentationMode` property that will allow the view to be dismissed when the user leaves the conversation/room, and a three-column wide grid where the room members will be displayed.

### Run Your Application

If you run the project (CMD + R), you will first be prompted to allow microphone permissions if you have not already.  

Log in with a username, and you will be taken to the room list screen where you can create a room. Creating a room will take you to the room view. Repeat the same steps with a different username and device, and you will be able to chat in the room!
