# What is Hacktoberfest

Running for the 8th year Hacktoberfest is an annual month long event where developers of all experience level get to contribute to open source projects, participate in events, complete pull request and donate to open source projects. Hacktoberfest is a great way for both new and experienced developers get to work on opensource projects. It is also a great way for project maintainer to attract new developer to help maintain the projects. 

## What works really well

After about 8 years of Hactoberfest it has become more or less a household name in developer community. Every years over hundred thousand developer participate in events and submitting PRs. Although Digital Ocean and Dev.to are primary sponsor of the event, many companies have their own events with swag for folks to join in and make the event even bigger. The whole developer community comes together to make this event a success.

## The dark side of Hactoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a great idea. Open source is the backbone of the software industry and having more people interested in using and contributing in open source is a good thing for the community. But like most thing there is always a catch. During Hacktoberfest there are chances of winning various swag like t-shirts and stickers and it incentivizes completing 4 pull request faster. Which in turn causes many people to open trivial and spam pull requests to popular open source projects. The problem was so bad, last year Hacktoberfest had to change rules so projects had to opt in with tags. 

All that being said here are some of the Do's and Don'ts of Hacktoberfest from a participant and maintainers perspective.

## Do's

* Be respectful to each other. As participant be mindful of project maintainers time. In most cases maintainer are volunteering their time to work on these projects. Coming in with a demand to get your PR merged is not helpful, nor is it okay to create a PR that fixes a typo or grammar that 4 other person has already fixed. For maintainers if you have the time please try to create proper expectations of what you would want help in. For many this will be first interaction they have with open source contribution. Your action may deter someone from helping in open source. 
* As participants read the project code of conduct and contributions guidelines. Many questions can be avoided by just looking through the docs and previous issues. Remember the ratio of participant vs maintainers is pretty low. As maintainer try to make it easy for people to find info. A good code of conduct and contributions guide go a long way to help folks get the info they need without creating a new issue.
* Look for projects that have \`Hacktoberfest\` and \`Good first issue\` tags. An easy way to find this is looking in the [Hactoberfest guide](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/beginners). 
* If you are project maintainer and would like to get some contributions you will need to setup the repositories first. In previous years all repos were eligible which led to some problems for maintainer. So this year you will have to setup your repositories beforehand. [Follow these steps](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/maintainers) from official Hactoberfest website. Also be prepared to spend some time with the PRs in either approving, rejecting or commenting on them. While you volunteer your time, so does the participants. 

## Don'ts

* As participants don't create spam PRs. You are excited about making your Hacktoberfest goals but in the other end of a spam PR is a real human that is spending their time trying to maintain an open source project. 
* Do not harass maintainer to merge your PR. A gentle reminder is not 10+ comments and emails. 
* Do not go about fixing grammatical and spelling errors unless the contribution guide explicitly asks for it. 
* As maintainers do not burn yourself out trying to entertain every PR and interaction. 
* Do not admonish folks for their bad PRs. Try to assume positive intent. You are the ambassador of open source for many of these developers who might be trying out open source for the first time. 





Finally, have fun with it. This is probably the biggest festivals us developers get. Yes we have had our problems with it. But I still believe it to be primarily a force for good.
