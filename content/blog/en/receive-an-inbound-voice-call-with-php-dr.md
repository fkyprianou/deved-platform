In our last PHP and voice blog post, we covered how to make an [outbound voice call using Text-To-Speech](/blog/2017/10/20/text-to-speech-voice-calls-with-php-dr/). In this post, we're going to change direction and write an application that handles inbound voice calls and returns a dynamic response.

The source code for this blog post is available [on Github](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-php-quickstart/tree/master/voice/inbound-calls-slim).

## Prerequisites

<sign-up number></sign-up>

You’ll need PHP installed before working through this post. I’m running PHP 7.2, but the code here should work on PHP 5.6 and above. You'll also need [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to download our dependencies.

Finally, you'll need the [Nexmo CLI](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli) installed. We'll be using this to configure our Nexmo account and purchase a phone number.

## Receiving a phone call with PHP

Before we get into the details about how it all works, we'll start by creating a PHP application to handle incoming voice calls. When a voice call is received, Nexmo will make a request to your application to find out how to respond to that call.

We're going to be using the [Slim framework](https://www.slimframework.com/) to handle the incoming request, so let's install it now with `composer`:

```bash
composer require slim/slim "^3.0"
```

Once that has completed, create a new file named `index.php` with the following contents. This will create a new Slim application and register a single endpoint (`/webhook/answer`) that accepts a `GET` request with a `from` query string parameter and returns the `from` value in the body.

```php
<?php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new \Slim\App;
$app->get('/webhook/answer', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $params = $request->getQueryParams();
    return $response->withJson($params['from']);
});

$app->run();
```

Save this file and then open up a new terminal window. Let's start the built in PHP server and serve our application on port 8000.

```bash
php -t . -S localhost:8000
```

If you visit [http://localhost:8000/webhook/answer?from=14155550100](http://localhost:8000/webhook/answer?from=14155550100), you will see the `from` number returned in the response body.

This is a great start, but Nexmo won't know what to do if we only respond with the caller's phone number. To tell Nexmo how to handle the call, we have to return an [NCCO](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/voice/ncco).

To keep things simple, we'll use Text-To-Speech to read the caller's phone number back to them, digit by digit. First, we split their number in to an array of characters, then join them together using spaces:

```php
$fromSplitIntoCharacters = implode(" ", str_split($params['from']));
```

Next, we define an NCCO that uses the `talk` action to read out these characters:

```php
$ncco = [
    [
        'action' => 'talk',
        'text' => 'Thank you for calling from '.$fromSplitIntoCharacters
    ]
];
```

Then finally, we return this NCCO instead of `$params['from']`:

```php
return $response->withJson($ncco);
```

When we put it all together, `index.php` looks like the following:

```php
<?php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new \Slim\App;
$app->get('/webhook/answer', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $params = $request->getQueryParams();
    $fromSplitIntoCharacters = implode(" ", str_split($params['from']));

    $ncco = [
        [
            'action' => 'talk',
            'text' => 'Thank you for calling from '.$fromSplitIntoCharacters
        ]
    ];

    return $response->withJson($ncco);
});

$app->run();
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000/webhook/answer?from=14155550100](http://localhost:8000/webhook/answer?from=14155550100) again and you will see the following returned:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "Thank you for calling from 1 4 1 5 5 5 5 0 1 0 0"
  }
]
```

Congratulations! You just wrote an application that receives an inbound phone call and responds with some dynamic content. You can customise your response using any of the parameters that Nexmo provide, including `to`, `from` and `conversation_uuid`.

## Exposing your application with ngrok

We've built an application that responds how we'd expect, but there's one big problem at the moment. Nexmo are supposed to make a request to it when a call is received but it's running on our local machine!

Don't worry though, ngrok can save the day. If you're unfamiliar with ngrok, there's a fantastic [introduction to ngrok](/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/) available on the Nexmo blog.

Once you have ngrok installed, run `ngrok http 8000` to expose your application to the internet. You'll need to make a note of the `ngrok` URL generated as we'll need to provide it to Nexmo (it'll look something like `http://abc123.ngrok.io`).

## Configure your Nexmo account

Once your application is exposed to the internet, the final thing to do is hook it up to a Nexmo phone number. Let's start by purchasing a phone number using the Nexmo CLI:

```bash
nexmo number:buy --country_code US
```

Make a note of the number you just purchased, as we'll need it in just a second!

The next step is to create a Nexmo application, which is a container for all the settings required for your application. In this case we need to tell Nemxo which URL to make a request to when a call is received (`answer_url`), and where to send any event information about the call (`event_url`).

We can use the Nexmo CLI to create an application, making sure to substitute `http://abc123.ngrok.io` for your own generated URL. We provide a name, then an `answer_url` and `event_url` for the application:

```bash
nexmo app:create "InboundCalls" http://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/answer http://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/event
```

You can ignore the private key output as it is not required to receive inbound calls. Above the key is your new application's ID. We do need that, so make a note (it'll look similar to `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab`) then carry on reading.

The final thing to do is to link the number you purchased to the application you just created. This will tell Nexmo that when a call is received, they should make a `GET` request to the application's `answer_url` to find out how to proceed with the call.

Once again, we can use the Nexmo CLI to do this, replacing the example phone number and application ID with your own:

```bash
nexmo link:app 14155550100 aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab
```

That's everything we needed to do for Nexmo to associate our PHP application to an incoming phone call. Give it a go now by calling the phone number you purchased.

## Conclusion

Together, we just built an application that can receive an incoming phone call and dynamically generate a response in just 22 lines of code!
