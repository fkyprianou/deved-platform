Hello everyone, I’m Bethany Loft and I am delighted to be joining the Nexmo Developer Relations Team as Junior Developer Community Event Manager. 

Originally from Hull, my northern accent got lost somewhere along the way as I was traveling as an au pair, an experience which put me on the path of studying Anthropology and brought me to London. The London office is where I will be based and I look forward to meeting everyone here and using the space for events! 

Having recently graduated from Goldsmiths University in Anthropology and Media, I join Nexmo with a background in events, activity administration and organising hackathons. 

Whilst studying, I joined [Hacksmiths](https://goldsmiths.tech/), Goldsmiths Tech Society which first exposed me to the huge amount of possible uses for tech and to the wonderful individuals who make the environment so special. My love of the tech community was established immediately and though, to the outside world, it was not the most obvious of choices to get involved with, it soon became hugely influential in my world. 

Having experienced welcoming, accessible and valuable events, I look forward to creating the same atmosphere for the Nexmo community. My passions include anthropology, environmentalism and reading almost any genres except horror and crime. I carry at least one book with me at all times in case of sneaky reading opportunities. 

I’m also overly enthusiastic about cheering on sports games - recently introducing more NFL and netball matches to my regular watching. I’m so excited about joining this team and community. If you’d like to connect, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bb_loft). I look forward to meeting you soon.
