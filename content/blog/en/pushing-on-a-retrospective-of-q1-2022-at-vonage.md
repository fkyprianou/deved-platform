# Pushing on: a retrospective of Q1 at Vonage

From a personal perspective, Q1 in the Vonage Developer Relations team was always set to be exciting. The world opened up again, we started booking in events to our calendars and we are back on the road, doing what we do best: talking to developers.

Given that we are active once again off the back of [phenomenal events in Q4 2021](https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2021/11/ericsson-to-acquire-vonage-for-usd-6.2-billion-to-spearhead-the-creation-of-a-global-network-and-communication-platform-for-open-innovation), it's well worth taking the time to slow down a bit (we're a busy bunch, and [now there's more of us!](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2022/03/23/zachary-powell-joins-the-developer-relations-team/)) and looking at what we have been working on, our content and successes we've had here over the past three months of 2022.

### Turning notifications to conversations

One of the ideas we are concentrating this year is revising how you communicate with your customers - in an ever growing, hyper-connected world it is sometimes not _enough_ to simply fire off notifications via typical mediums (email, SMS etc). What we're looking at is to how to turn these from one-way traffic into meaningful conversations to enhance your business's ability to communicate.

##### 10DLC
Application-to-person (A2P) messaging in the United States has seen the launch of a major new standard, 10DLC (which stands for 10-Digit Long Code). Messaging communications sent through the major carriers such as Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T are now registered and signed to ensure system-generated communications are from a trusted source. You can read more about 10DLC and how it impacts your business [in this article by Cory Althoff]().

##### New WhatsApp Conversational Pricing
In February 2022, WhatsApp introduced a new pricing model for conversation-based messaging. In line with this, Vonage has introduced new enhanced conversation-based pricing, which affects initiated messaging between a customer and business in one 24 hour _session_. Our documentation has been updated according for more information - [you can find everything you'll need to take advantage of this new model here.](https://developer.vonage.com/messages/concepts/whatsapp)

#### Release Notes

Something about release note pages, Paul to investigate.

### Video...Everywhere!

We're excited about the work the engineering and product teams are doing to evolve our Video API products, and this quarter has seen a handful of *big* updates for us to get our teeth into from a developers' perspective.

##### Meetings API

Expected from Avital on March 30th

#### Interactive Broadcast Beta Announced

Our Developer Advocate Garann Means [wrote an article on lessons learned after two years of Virtual Conferences](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2022/03/14/lessons-learned-after-two-years-of-virtual-tech-conferences/) , and how we approached Developer Relations during the time of COVID has certainly been a hot topic.

So, given our experiences with conference online platforms and the successes or failures of how they are implemented, what apt timing for the announcement that, as a developer, you can implement your own solution! The Vonage Video API now has a big feature update that introduces true _Interactive Broadcast_ experiences for end users. [You can find the Press Release here. EDIT: LIVE DOCS COPY UNDER EMBARGO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q4Y7KrvGSqDmwYHwS7TrB7Nipgfr7qCm2j8aF3n8wYs/edit).

Among the features we've released include: 

* using our new *Experience Composer* to broadcast full HD streams to up to 15,000 active participants in a new, highly customisable platform
* protocol choices between WebRTC or HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) for lower latency interactions between your hosts and your participants
* Stream with additional costs to all major social media platforms such as Twitch and Facebook Live

You can read more in-depth about the new features in [this post, from Senior Product Manager Jon Montana](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2021/05/11/video-api-better-interactive-broadcasts-and-recordings/#).

Naturally our Developer Advocates wanted to get their hands on these new features to check them out. [In this article](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2021/12/15/create-a-personal-twitch-with-vonage-video-api-and-web-components/) you can read up on our JavaScript Advocate [Dwayne Hemmings](https://twitter.com/lifelongdev) writing on [using the VideoAPI and Web Components to create a personal Twitch-like broadcasting platform](https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2021/12/15/create-a-personal-twitch-with-vonage-video-api-and-web-components/).

Want to see some of these high definition features in action? We've got you covered! Our Video API Advocate [Mofi Rahman](https://twitter.com/moficodes) wrote an article on implementing HLS broadcasts
