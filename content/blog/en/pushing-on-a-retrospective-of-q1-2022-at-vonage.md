From a personal perspective, Q1 in the Vonage Developer Relations team was always set to be exciting. The world opened up again, we started booking in events to our calendars and we are back on the road, doing what we do best: talking to developers.

Given that we are active once again off the back of [phenomenal events in Q4 2021](https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2021/11/ericsson-to-acquire-vonage-for-usd-6.2-billion-to-spearhead-the-creation-of-a-global-network-and-communication-platform-for-open-innovation), it's well worth taking the time to slow down a bit (we're a busy bunch, and [now there's more of us!](<>)) and looking at what we have been working on, our content and successes we've had here over the past three months of 2022.

### Turning notifications to conversations

One of the ideas we are concentrating this year is revising how you communicate with your customers - in an ever growing, hyper-connected world it is sometimes not *enough* to simply fire off notifications via typical mediums (email, SMS etc). What we're looking at is to how to turn these from one-way traffic into meaningful conversations to enhance your business's ability to communicate.

##### 10DLC

Application-to-person (A2P) messaging in the United States has seen the launch of a major new standard, 10DLC (which stands for 10-Digit Long Code). Messaging communications sent through the major carriers such as Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T are now registered and signed to ensure system-generated communications are from a trusted source. You can read more about 10DLC and how it impacts your business [in this article by Cory Althoff](<>).

##### New WhatsApp Conversational Pricing

In February 2022, WhatsApp introduced a new pricing model for conversation-based messaging. In line with this, Vonage has introduced new enhanced conversation-based pricing, which affects initiated messaging between a customer and business in one 24 hour *session*. Our documentation has been updated according for more information - [you can find everything you'll need to take advantage of this new model here.](https://developer.vonage.com/messages/concepts/whatsapp)
