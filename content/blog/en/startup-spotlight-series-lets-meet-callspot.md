Back in 2008, Roman Ray wrote “The Best Salesperson: Your Website”, explaining how a company’s best sales person is actually their website. 

Fast forward to over a decade later, websites are the main source of truth and play a central role in customer acquisition. We live in an era where information is available freely on the internet; therefore, companies need to do everything to serve their potential customers as efficiently and quickly as possible.

To enable companies to sell faster and help customers make more informed purchase decisions, Callspot was founded in 2020. A call analytics SaaS platform that helps businesses convert their web visitors into warm sales calls in less than 28 seconds. 

Callspot recently joined our Vonage for Startups program, and this week we caught up with their CEO, Fotis Chatzidakis to find out more about how their sales analytics platform is reducing the sales time, leading to higher efficiency both for companies and customers.

## In one sentence, what does Callspot do?

Callspot is a SaaS call analytics platform that helps businesses convert their web visitors into sales calls.

## What is the problem you are solving? Was this the initial problem or did you pivot?

Callspot features can dramatically reduce caller abandonment and increase customer satisfaction. Our Callback allows any caller to request an instant and free-of-charge callback. Our Call-Scheduling allows any caller waiting in a queue to schedule a callback and wait for an agent to return their call.

\
This was the initial problem. 

## VC, Angel, Bootstrap or Other?

Bootstrap. So far, we considered it to be the best option since it allowed us to get started without losing time looking for investors. In addition, we used our time to create a powerful MVP with essential features that gives value to our customers from the very first minute.\
\
As Richard Branson has said, you should pursue a scale-up when you are ready, not just when the opportunity shows up. Some months ago, we were contacted by investors who were interested in investing in us, but we refused as we believed it was not the right time. We were not ready. Usually, entrepreneurs who accept funding recklessly, without critical thinking, are very likely to create unnecessary risks in their company.\
\
However, as we are now entering the fourth quarter since we officially launched, and after testing our product with several clients and real-case scenarios, we are confident to start discussing with investors in order to bring Callspot to the next level.

## What’s the biggest challenge you faced and how did you overcome it?

The time. When you work full-time, in senior positions and in internationally competitive environments, as the day goes on both mental clarity and endurance are decreased. So in order to succeed, and at the same time, to create and build your own company, you need to activate the deepest reserves of resilience and will in order to fight mental and physical fatigue.\
\
To achieve this you need one basic thing - desire. Desire to see your vision come true. The greater the desire, the more likely it is to overcome fatigue.\
\
Also, Covid-19 slowed us down. While e-commerce has skyrocketed all over the world, many companies with which we were in the final stages of discussions chose to freeze the process in order to first see how things will turn out, adjust their strategies and then act.

## The biggest mistake Callspot has made so far and what did you learn from it?

Initially, we targeted the public sector, and especially the local authorities, prompted by the hard truth that the waiting time in most public services is insane. Our Call-scheduling feature prompts visitors to automatically schedule callbacks for  the next day instead of leaving a missed call. Also, no more overnight shifts are needed as Callspot runs on the website 24/7. So there was a need that we could cover.\
\
Eventually it turned out that the insane waiting time is not stopped in the services; it applies to most of the decision making processes as well. We roughly lost around 4-5 months, being in discussions with many municipalities around possible synergies that were never really meant to happen, or that they would require many rounds of discussions with governing councils without any assurance that our efforts will be successful. 

Lesson learned: Be willing to let it go.

## You can choose one to be on your board: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Who do you choose and why? 

Jeff Bezos. Amazon was responsible for running a platform that accounted for up to 9% of all U.S. retail sales and a whopping 51.2% of digital retail spending in 2020. If we could put our widget on Amazon's website, it would only take an hour, maybe even less, to establish Callspot as the new call management software that helps businesses convert their web visitors into sales calls by communicating faster and more personally with their potential customers.

## What progress have you made since launching? 

\
Our intelligent algorithms pre-qualify the most prospective visitors and engage only them in real-time voice conversations.

We have 3 main features.

1. Call-me-now: Driving relevant traffic to your website is hard work and getting those visitors to convert is even harder. With the Call-me-now feature, visitors can request a callback. The widget seamlessly connects your visitors to your sales team in 25 seconds via intelligent callback technology.

2.  Call-scheduling: With the Call-scheduling feature, visitors can schedule a callback for the date and time they like. Our widget detects after-business hours and prompts customers to automatically schedule callbacks for the next day instead of leaving a missed call. Also, no more overnight shifts are needed as Callspot runs on your website 24/7.

3.  Call-Analytics: When your agents are connected to a potential client they will see where the caller came from, the pages they have visited, the page they are currently on, the keywords they used to find you, which country and city they are in.

Callspot can be used for:

- Sales: The widget seamlessly connects your site visitor to your sales team in less than a minute and makes customers 10-15 times more likely to buy again in the future.

- Marketing: When it comes to responding to your leads, every minute matters. Making them wait longer than 5 minutes means an 80% decrease both in lead qualification and ROI of marketing campaigns.

- Customer support: No more overnight shifts as Callspot will run on your website 24/7. It detects after-business hours and helps to automatically schedule callbacks for your sales team the next day instead of leaving a missed call.

## What’s next for Callspot? Where do you want to be in 3 years?

We aim for new markets, more clients, more features. We want to grow our customer base both in Greece and abroad, create more lead generation features, provide integrations with business tools, and develop an omnichannel infrastructure in order to unify the synchronisation of all customer contact points on our platform.
