Any company I ever phone always has one of those automated answering systems that ask me questions before I get to speak to a real person, and because I'm a bit weird, I've always thought "why can't *I* have one of those?"

My daughter started secondary school a few months ago, and the form they sent us to fill in only had *one slot for a contact phone number*. What happens if we give them my details and I'm unavailable? Lucky for me, I work for Vonage, and know how to set up a phone number capable of forwarding calls to either one of us - or both! *Vonage to the rescue!*

## What We're Going to Build

1. The school is given a Vonage number as a contact number.
2. If they call the number, an automated message gives them the following options:

   1. List the parents' names, with a digit to press to be forwarded to each parent.
   2. If the caller does nothing, forward to the first parent in the list.
   3. Press '*' if there is an emergency. This will set up a conference call and dial in both parents.

I had another couple of requirements:

1. Be simple, and practically free to host and run.
2. No database to manage, for added simplicity.

## How We're Going to Build It

I've chosen a couple of technologies I'm most familiar with - Python 3.6 and Flask. I've chosen Python 3.6 because that was the release that came with *f-strings* and they're great! I'm also using [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/) to manage my Python dependencies.

This combination allows us to build a great home IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system in just over 100 lines of code!

<sign-up></sign-up>

## Let's Go!

First let's set up our development environment.

Because Vonage needs to call the server you're going to write, and your laptop is sitting behind a nice, secure firewall, you'll probably want to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for local development - let me recommend my colleague Aaron's [excellent blog post about using ngrok](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/).

You'll probably want to install *pipenv* globally, and from then on we'll use it to manage our project's virtual environment:

```bash
sudo pip install --upgrade pipenv
```

Now let's install the dependencies we'll need for this project, and activate our virtual environment. Run these commands in your new project's directory - I've called mine `hotline`:

```bash
# Install compatible versions of `nexmo`, `flask` and `attrs`
pipenv install nexmo~=2.3 flask~=1.0.2 attrs~=18.2.0

# Activate the virtualenv:
pipenv shell
```

Now let's start writing our Flask server.

Open up a file called `hotline.py`, and type the following:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/incoming/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def incoming():
    """
    An HTTP endpoint which handles incoming calls.

    :return: A JSON HTTP response containing the main menu NCCO actions.
    """
    return jsonify(
        [
            {
                "action": "talk",
                "text": "Welcome to the Brockman family hotline",
                "voiceName": "Amy",
            }
        ]
    )
```

Now, in *separate terminal windows* you'll want to run the following at the same time:

```bash
# Tunnel requests to local port 5000 (Flask's default port):
$ ngrok http 5000
```

```bash
# Start your Flask server:
$ FLASK_APP=hotline flask run --debugger --reload
```

When you run *ngrok*, it prints out the generated domain name it will forward through to your server. It will look something like this: `https://abcde1234.ngrok.io -> localhost:5000`. So now you can test your Flask app at `https://abcde1234.ngrok.io/incoming` (replace abcde1234 with whatever was printed on your terminal).

You should see something like this:

![First NCCO test](/content/blog/build-a-family-hotline-with-vonage/first_test.png "First Test")

## Make a Phone Call to Your Server

Now you need to configure a *Vonage Virtual Number* to call your server when someone calls your number. So now you need 3 things:

1. A [Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up)
2. A configured Voice application
3. A configured Vonage Virtual Number.

### Create a Vonage Account

[Sign up](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up) for an account on the Vonage website.

### Install the Nexmo CLI

Follow the installation instructions in the [Nexmo CLI README](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli/blob/master/README.md).
This is generally a really useful tool for configuring your account.

### Create a Voice Application

```bash
$ nexmo app:create \
    --type voice \
    --answer_method POST \
    --event_method POST \
    --keyfile hotline.pem \
    "Home Hotline" \
    https://ed330676.ngrok.io/incoming/ \
    https://ed330676.ngrok.io/event/

Application created: 34abcd12-ef12-40e3-9c6c-4274b3633761
Private Key saved to: hotline.pem
```

You'll want to save that ID that's printed out after `Application created:`. You'll need it in the next step.

### Buy a Number and Link it to Your Voice App

This step is where the command-line interface really comes into its own - the following is just 3 commands:

```bash
# Search for numbers in your country:
# (I'm in Scotland, so I use GB. In the USA, you'd use US)
$ nexmo number:search GB
447700900462
447700900463
...
447700900465
447700900466
447700900467

# Pick a number you like from the list, and buy it:
$ nexmo number:buy 447700900466
Buying 447700900466. This operation will charge your account.

Please type "confirm" to continue: confirm

Number purchased: 447700900466

# Link the number to your Voice app (use the app ID you saved from earlier):
$ nexmo link:app 447700900466  34abcd12-ef12-40e3-9c6c-4274b3633761
Number updated
```

**Okay**!

Now you can test all that by calling the phone number you just bought. You should hear Amy read out the message "Welcome to the Brockman family hotline." If you hear a message saying the number was not recognised, or things don't work out, open the ngrok debug page at `http://127.0.0.1:4040/` in your browser so you can see what requests came in and whether the server responded correctly.

## Responding to INPUT

Let's change the message and add an input action to our menu NCCO so that the caller can select the person they wish to speak to:

```python
@app.route("/incoming/", methods=["POST", "GET"])
def incoming():
    """
    An HTTP endpoint which handles incoming calls.
    """
    return jsonify(
        [
            {
                "action": "talk",
                "text": """
                    Welcome to the Brockman family hotline.
                    To speak to Pete Brockman, please press 1.
                    To speak to Sue Brockman, please press 2.
                """,
                "voiceName": "Amy",
                "bargeIn": True,
            },
            {
                "action": "input",
                "eventUrl": [url_for("family_selection")],
                "maxDigits": 1,
            },
        ]
    )


@app.route("/family-selection/", methods=["POST"])
def family_selection():
    """
    An HTTP endpoint which handles the DTMF input from the main menu.
    """
    postdata = request.json

    if postdata["timed_out"]:
        index = 0
    else:
        index = int(postdata["dtmf"]) - 1
    return jsonify([{
        "action": "talk",
        "text": f"You selected the {index} option",
    }])
```

**Don't call it just yet!** We're not quite ready ... but, let me explain what this does:

I added this to the `talk` action:

```python
"bargeIn": True,
```

This means that the caller can press a number on their phone while the `talk` action is still reading them the message. It will automatically activate the following `input` action. I also added the following action:

```python
{
    "action": "input",
    "eventUrl": [url_for("family_selection")],
    "maxDigits": 1,
},
```

This `input` action tells Vonage to call the `family_selection` function we've also just added. Flask's `url_for` function provides the URL for the given function name.

### A Neat Use of `partial`

`url_for` by default generates a *relative* URL. Relative URLs aren't supported by Vonage Voice -- so, I've added the following to the top of the file:

```python
from functools import partial

from flask import url_for as url_for_

# We don't have any use for relative URLs, so hard-code this param:
url_for = partial(url_for_, _external=True)
```

This use of partial sets the `url_for` function to something more useful - it's a copy of Flask's `url_for` function, but with the default value of the `_external` parameter set to `True`. (I forgot to set this parameter *so many times* before I fixed it with this!)

Once you've added that to your file and ensured your server has reloaded, it's time to call your number again. It should read you the message, allow you to pick a number on your phone, and then read you out that number with one subtracted from it. If you wait for a few seconds, it should then tell you that you selected `zero`.

Why am I subtracting 1 from the number they entered? It's so we can select a person from a list! If the test above went well, let's put our people in a list and make this menu a bit more dynamic.

## Forwarding Calls

The first thing we really need is a better way of configuring our "parents". It's nice to have a list of the people we will want to forward calls to. For the moment, let's define their details in the Python file. Please don't do this with real phone numbers and commit to a public repository!

```python
import attr

@attr.s
class Endpoint:
    """ A data class containing a potential callee's details. """
    name = attr.ib()
    phone_number = attr.ib()

ENDPOINTS = [
    Endpoint(name="Pete Brockman", phone_number="447700900123"),
    Endpoint(name="Sue Brockman", phone_number="447700900456"),
]
NEXMO_NUMBER = "447700900847"
```

In the code above, I'm using the amazing [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/) library to define a simple class, `Endpoint`, for holding a person's name and phone number. I'm then creating a list of `Endpoint`s for the people we may want to forward calls to.

Now I add a simple utility function for generating `talk` actions. It will make the code more readable and means that by default we'll be using the `Amy` voice. You can get a list of all the voices Vonage supports [here](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech#voice-names)

```python
def talk(message, voice="Amy", barge_in=None):
    """ Utility function to generate a `talk` NCCO action. """
    response = {"action": "talk", "text": message, "voiceName": voice}
    if barge_in is not None:
        response["bargeIn"] = barge_in

    return response
```

And *now* I've factored out the code for generating the main menu message:

```python
def make_answer_message(message, endpoints):
    """
    Generate a script to be read to the caller, informing them of their options.
    """
    endpoint_options = [
        f"To speak to {endpoint.name}, please press {code}."
        for code, endpoint in enumerate(endpoints, start=1)
    ]

    return " ".join([message, *endpoint_options, "If you're not sure, please hold."])
```

You see that `*endpoint_options` in the last line of the code above? Did you know you can do this in Python 3 to expand a list into another list? In this case, the result is that we end up with a list of strings that we can join together with spaces.

You can now replace the `talk` action in the `incoming` method with the following call to the `talk` function:

```python
talk(
    make_answer_message(
        "Welcome to the Brockman family hotline.", ENDPOINTS
    ),
    barge_in=True,
),
```

And finally, you can modify the `family_selection` function so that it will actually forward the call to a phone number:

```python
@app.route("/family-selection/", methods=["POST"])
def family_selection():
    """
    An HTTP endpoint which handles the DTMF input from the main menu.
    """
    postdata = request.json

    try:
        if postdata["timed_out"]:
            index = 0
        else:
            index = int(postdata["dtmf"]) - 1

        if index < len(ENDPOINTS):
            # They elected to speak to an individual
            endpoint = ENDPOINTS[index]
            return jsonify(
                [
                    talk(f"Connecting to {endpoint.name}"),
                    {
                        "action": "connect",
                        "from": NEXMO_NUMBER,
                        "endpoint": [{"type": "phone", "number": endpoint.phone_number}],
                    },
                ]
            )
    except ValueError:
        pass  # This is raised by `int`, and can be ignored - we just forward on to the following error message...

    return jsonify([talk("I didn't understand that option.")])
```

The code above looks quite a lot more complicated than it did before, but that's because we're now doing some error checking and telling the caller if they pressed a key we didn't expect. If the user presses 1 or 2, they'll be read a message saying that they're being connected, and then they will be connected to the endpoint's number.

Okay, so what have we done so far?

* The school can call my number and they're read a list of people they can connect to.
* If they press 1 or 2 they'll be connected to that person. (Incidentally, neither side of the phone call can see each other's phone number, so this is a great way to anonymise calls!)
* If the caller waits they'll be connected to the first endpoint in the configured list.

We could stop here if we want, but I had a *third requirement*: In case of an emergency, the caller could hit `star`, and it would call both of us and dial us all into a conference call.

## Adding a Conference Call Option

A conference call is created with a `conversation` action, and it ends (by default) when there are no more people on the call. The only thing we need to connect a person to a conference call is the name that we gave the conference call with the first `conversation` action.

### Initialise a Client Object

We're going to need a Vonage `Client` object to create outbound calls to the parents, so it's lucky we installed the Vonage Python library at the start of this tutorial, right? Put the following lines near the top of your file. If you *want* to, you can paste your `application_id` and `private_key` values directly into the file, but I think it's better to load them from environment variables instead. It's too easy to commit them to a public repository, and anyone who has them can spend *your* Vonage balance!

```python
nexmo_client = nexmo.Client(
    application_id=os.getenv('NEXMO_APPLICATION_ID'),
    private_key=os.getenv('NEXMO_PRIVATE_KEY')
)
```

### Tell the User They Can Press '*'

Before we do that, add the message `"If this is an emergency, please press star."` to the string returned by our `make_answer_message` function. I added it just after the `message` item in the list.

### Create a Conference Call

Now let's create our conference call. Take a deep breath; it's a reasonably big block of code.

We'll need a new HTTP endpoint, called `conference_ncco`, which will provide NCCO actions for each of the parents being dialled into the conference call.

I've abstracted out all the code for dialling out to the parents and generating NCCO actions for the caller into a function called `create_conference_call`.

I'm pasting the two functions together so you can see how the conference_id parameter, which is generated in `create_conference_call` is embedded in the URL path to the `conference_ncco` endpoint so that it knows the name of the conference call to embed in the `conversation` NCCO action.

```python
@app.route("/conference/<conference_id>/ncco", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def conference_ncco(conference_id: str):
    """
    An HTTP endpoint which generates the NCCO actions to connect a callee to
    a conference call.
    """
    return jsonify(
        [
            talk("You are being connected to a family hotline conference call."),
            {"action": "conversation", "name": conference_id},
        ]
    )

def create_conference_call(endpoints):
    """
    Generate an NCCO response to connect the caller to all the provided
    `endpoints` in a single conference call.
    """
    # Generate a unique name for our conference:
    conference_name = str(uuid.uuid4())

    # Loop through the endpoints and dial them into the conference call:
    for endpoint in endpoints:
        nexmo_client.create_call(
            {
                "to": [{"type": "phone", "number": endpoint.phone_number}],
                "from": {"type": "phone", "number": NEXMO_NUMBER},
                "answer_url": [
                    url_for("conference_ncco", conference_id=conference_name)
                ],
            }
        )
        print(f"Dialing {endpoint.phone_number} into {conference_name}")

    # Connect the inbound leg to the conference call we're creating:
    return jsonify(
        [
            talk("Connecting all parties."),
            {
                "action": "conversation",
                "name": conference_name,
            },
        ]
    )
```

### Handle a Star Input

Now, we just need to modify `family_selection` so it knows what to do with a `*` dtmf code, by putting this near the top of the function:

```python
if postdata["dtmf"] == "*":
    return create_conference_call(ENDPOINTS)
```

### Test It!

Call your Vonage number, and follow each of the instructions in the main menu to check that they work! If it's all working, then it's time to deploy it!

### Deploy It!

If you check out the [Git repository](https://github.com/nexmo-community/family-hotline) for this project
you'll see that I've made some minor changes to it, including loading all configuration from environment
variables, and adding a Procfile. This should mean that it's relatively straightforward to deploy to Heroku - but I'll leave that as an exercise for you! Don't forget to update your Vonage Application's configuration to point at the new Heroku URL instead of the ngrok URL you've been using for development.

Once it's deployed, it's time to talk to your child's school and ask them to update your contact details!

# What Did We Do?

We built a whole IVR system to allow the school to contact us! It can forward calls to individual numbers, or connect everyone in one conference call!

## Further Credit

Some more things I considered doing with this server include:

* Forwarding SMS messages sent to the number to both parents.
* Sending text messages to inform a parent if they missed a call from the school.
* Creating a 'race' call that would call both parents and the first one to answer takes the call. The second call would be cut and be sent an SMS saying the other parent had handled it.
* If no parent picks up, allowing the school to record a message, which would then be available for both parents to pick up.
* Integration with a family Slack, with alerts for incoming phone calls, forwarding of SMS messages to the Slack, and even posting of recorded messages to be played within the Slack!
