Hello! I’m Myrsini and I’ve recently joined the Developer Relations team at Nexmo. 

As a Community Manager, I will be helping our team support and engage with developers around the world. 

My background spans from events to content and everything in between. I’ve worked for an NGO, a tech company, a startup, a communications agency and as a freelancer. 

I first got into Dev Rel in 2014 when I joined PayPal and Braintree, where our mission was to empower developers and startups. Our most notable initiative was the global hackathon series [BattleHack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbwHgfE9iZw&index=24&list=UUAevX_Hrd_Avrz1DRhGyLrQ), during which, teams had to develop an app that solved a local problem. Amongst the winners’ spoils was an *axe*. Yes, you read that right, an axe that I was responsible for getting through customs in every country we visited. I will only discuss this time of my life over wine. 

In 2016 I was fortunate to spend some time with [MLH](https://mlh.io/), the official student hackathon league. I got the chance to meet amazing next-gen developers and help them learn, build and share at MLH first party events. 

Recently, I’ve been exploring my passion for content creation. This has included working on video scripts, blog posts, event concepts, you name it. I’ve been lucky to work on creative and strategic projects across various industries and I’m able to apply all that learning to this field. However, I’ve been itching to get back into DevRel. 

I’m so excited to reconnect and work with new developer communities! I hope to see you at an event soon. 

Until then feel free to connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Myrsiningos). Especially if you need any tips on planning your event, conference, wedding, dinner party. I’m open to discussions that include fluffy animals, movies, tennis, candle making and cheese. 

P.S: The building you see in the photo above is the [Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center](https://www.snfcc.org/default.aspx), designed by [Renzo Piano](https://www.ted.com/talks/renzo_piano_the_genius_behind_some_of_the_world_s_most_famous_buildings?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tedspread#t-142889). It’s near my family home in Athens, Greece. A must-visit whenever I’m back in the country.
