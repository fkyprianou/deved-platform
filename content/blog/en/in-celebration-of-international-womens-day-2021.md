The official theme of [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/) 2021 is "Choose to Challenge." At Vonage, we believe that together, we can choose to challenge and call out gender bias and inequity. We can choose to seek out and celebrate women's achievements. Collectively, we can *all* help create a more inclusive world.

Each year, in honour of International Women's Day, the global Vonage community comes together to celebrate the incredible journeys, stories and voices of our colleagues and the amazing people around us. 2021 is no exception.

## Stories and Journeys From Our Colleagues

In [2020](https://www.nexmo.com/legacy-blog/2020/03/10/in-celebration-of-international-womens-day-2020), we began the tradition of collecting personal stories from the Vonage community for Dev.to's "[Nevertheless, She Coded](https://dev.to/devteam/shecoded-2021-stories-from-women-building-software-and-the-allies-supporting-them-49pf)" initiative. Dev.to's annual celebration has blossomed into a beautiful collection of experiences, with each voice adding powerful perspective, wisdom, and advice.
