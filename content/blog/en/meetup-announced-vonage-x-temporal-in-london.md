Either way, you are invited to join the [Vonage DevRex Team](https://developer.vonage.com/en/team) and [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) for a meetup event on 30th March 2023, from 18:30 - 20:00 GMT. Held at [The Angelic](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Angelic/@51.5347895,-0.1073453,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47d91328984e6d5b:0xa5aa2fea6c2d9f75!8m2!3d51.5347895!4d-0.1073453!16s%2Fg%2F11_q905dg) in Islington, [join us](https://vonage.dev/3YAWi1c) for an evening of content, networking and some fun and games.

W﻿e are excited to announce two live talks:

**\- Who Can Improve Customer Experience? You? Yes, You!**  \
*[Benjamin-Michael Aronov, Developer Advocate, Vonage](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/authors/benjamin-aronov)*

Keeping your customers happy can be difficult. They want answers, now! Help your customers get the information they are looking for, on any channel they want. In this session we'll talk about Vonage's Communication API suite and lowcode tools that help developers and non-developers alike, create delightful interactions for their end users

**\- Escape Queue Abyss with Durable Execution** \
*[Maxim Fateev, Co-Founder/CEO, Temporal Technologies](https://twitter.com/mfateev?lang=en)*

"Durable Execution" is an emerging programming model concept that automatically and transparently handles the creation and use of queues in order to run your code with complete reliability at the platform level. The presentation will introduce you to some of the concepts and level you up into a whole new world called Durable Execution. It will also allow you to climb out of the abyss of disjointed services and into clouds of reliable solutions.

F﻿ollowing the talks we will have plenty of time for free networking, and a chance to win some great prizes in our raffle. Attendees will also be treated exclusive coupon codes for the Vonage Developer Platform and some super cool swag too. 

**W﻿ho are we?**

[Vonage](https://developer.vonage.com/en/home) is a cloud communications platform that allows developers to integrate voice, video and messaging into their applications using their communication APIs. So whether you want to build video calls into your app, create a Facebook bot, or build applications on top of programmable phone numbers, Vonage has got you covered.

[Temporal](https://temporal.io/) is a microservice orchestration platform which enables developers to build scalable applications without sacrificing productivity or reliability. Temporal server executes units of application logic, Workflows, in a resilient manner that automatically handles intermittent failures, and retries failed operations.
