Hello! My name is Zachary (Or Zach, or even Zac!) Powell and i'm excited to announce that I have joined Vonage as the new Sr Android Developer Advocate. 

I've had a love for Android through out my whole career, having started as an Android developer all the way back in 2009. It all started with my first smart phone the HTC Magic (T-mobile myTouch 3G), with its massive 192 MB of RAM and 528 MHz single core ARM cpu we finally had an open mobile platform to build real applications on! 

Fast forward to the start of 2021 when i made the move into DevRel, the next big leap in my career, moving away from the world of being a software engineer and moving into the world of... well educating software engineers! It was this jump that made me realise that while i loved writing code I also love teaching, presenting, creating content and all the other wonderful things that make up being a Developer Advocate.

So what will i be doing as Sr Android Developer Advocate i hear you ask. Well, lots! I will be working closely with both Android communities and internal developer teams to make sure we can make the very best Android SDK's for Vonage services. We already have some great SDK's and documentation but i will help maintain these as well as create new content to help you make the very best use of Vonage services within your Android applications. 

What kind of content? Of course I will be continuing my social media accounts (DevWithZachary almost everywhere!), so if you are not already make sure to check out my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devwithzachary) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@devwithzachary). But I will also be working on new blog posts, new sample applications and of course heading to events and meet ups to present, share ideas and build connections.
