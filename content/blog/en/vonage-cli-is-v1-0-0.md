Today marks a very proud moment for everyone here. Our Vonage CLI (Command Line Interface) is now v1.0.0. I honestly couldn't be happier with how things have gone so far, and I know they will only get better from here. 

## What's In v1?

### Applications
You can now manage your applications from the command line. The Vonage CLI will allow you to create, update, link numbers to, and even delete applications. 

```shell
vonage apps --help
vonage apps:create
```
You will also be able to manage application users, in-app conversations, and conversation members.

### Numbers
At the core of Vonage is the telephone - it's how I first learned of them 17 years ago. The Vonage CLI will let you buy or cancel phone numbers, search our inventory, and view yours. 

```shell
vonage numbers --help
vonage numbers:search US
```

### Number Insights

Vonage's Number Insight API delivers real-time intelligence about a phone number's validity, reachability, and roaming status. You can now have these insights on the command line - in basic, standard and advanced. 

```shell
vonage numberinsight --help
```

### JWT and Friends
And lastly, the Vonage CLI can create a JWT in your terminal for testing and development. You can also check your account balance. 

```shell
vonage jwt --help
vonage balance --help
```

## Getting Started

The latest core is on npm and you can install it with:

```
npm install -g @vonage/cli
```

Once you have that installed, you will need to go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/) to grab your API key and secret, and set your config with the following:

```shell
vonage config:set --apiKey=XXXXXX --apiSecret=XXXXXX
```

Now you are set to start exploring using `--help, -h` on any command. 

## What happens to the Nexmo CLI?
The Nexmo CLI will move into maintenance mode and receive bug fixes for the next yearâ€”until September 21, 2022. At that time, it will officially deprecate and will no longer be supported. 

## Final Request
I only want the best tools here, but I can't do it without you. Your feedback and support are fantastic, and with all of us working together, we can make the future of our CLI something special.
