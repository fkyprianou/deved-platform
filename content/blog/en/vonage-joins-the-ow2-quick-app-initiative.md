Vonage is proud to announce that they have joined the [OW2 Quick App Initiative](https://quick-app-initiative.ow2.io/) (QAI)! 

The QAI is an open-source initiative that is exploring technologies, use cases and business dynamics focused on Quick Apps. 

The initiative is a respectful, consensus-driven community, founded on the ideals of open-source (transparency, collaboration, sharing, open to all). It operates in accordance with a community agreed [charter](https://quick-app-initiative.ow2.io/docs/charter.pdf) and is overseen by [OW2](https://www.ow2.org/view/Main/), one of Europe’s preeminent open source organisations.

If you are interested in learning more about the Initiative itself they also have a detailed [whitepaper](https://quick-app-initiative.ow2.io/page/whitepaper/) outlining the goals of the initiative.

**But what are Quick Apps? and why does Vonage want to get involved?** 

Quick Apps implement emerging [W3C MiniApp standards](https://www.w3.org/2021/miniapps/) using a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework with a declarative user interface and predefined components to design reactive apps. They are already massively popular within China, were many of the largest mobile manufactures support the technology. As the demand for instant apps grows across the world we believe that Quick Apps could be a strong player in this market and unlock new and interesting app dynamics.

Vonage believes that communication APIs will play an important and powerful part in these kinds of instant, widely available applications. By joining the Initiative Vonage will explore how communication APIs can be used within Quick Apps. 

We will be conducting research into use cases and business requirements for instant, widely available mobile applications. From this we can develop sample applications and documentation to help developers introduce communication APIs into their Quick Apps and highlight further use cases for such technologies.
