## Introduction

The [Vonage SMS API](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/overview) allows you to send text messages programmatically. This tutorial covers how to use the Vonage SMS API with Vapor to send an SMS.



## Prerequisites

<sign-up></sign-up>

* Xcode 12 and Swift 5 or greater.
* The [Vapor toolbox](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/install/macos/) installed on your machine.

## Create a Vapor Project

You can create a Vapor project using the new project command `vapor new SwiftTextMessage` in your terminal. It will first prompt you whether you would like to Fluent (press `n` to skip), then whether you want to use Leaf. [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/leaf/getting-started) is a templating language that you will use to generate dynamic HTML pages, so press `y` to include it. 
Once the command has finished, change directory into the folder it created for you using `cd SwiftTextMessage`. 

You will also need to create a `.env` file to store your Vonage API account credentials. In your terminal, use the following command to create the file replacing `X` and `Y` with your API key and secret, respectively:

```shell
echo "APIKEY=X \nAPISECRET=Y" > .env
```

Now you can open the project in Xcode using `vapor xcode`. Once Xcode opens, it will start downloading the dependencies that Vapor relies on using Swift Package Manager (SPM). To view the dependencies, you can open the `Package.swift` file. 

By default, Xcode runs your application from a randomized local directory. Since you will be loading local resources, you need to set a custom working directory. Go to *Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme...* and set the working directory to your project's root folder.

![Setting custom working directory](/content/blog/how-to-send-sms-messages-with-swift-vapor-and-vonage/workingdir.png "Setting custom working directory")

 Press CMD+R to build and run. Once complete, find your web page at `localhost:8080`.

## Create a Web Page

Now that your project is set up, you will create an interface to enter a phone number and message for the SMS. Open the `index.leaf` file under *Resources/Views* and update it: 

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Send a text message</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Send a text message using the Vonage SMS API</h1>

    #if(status):
      <p> Status of the last SMS: #(status)</p>
    #endif

    <form action="/send" method="post">
        <p>
        <label>Phone number E.g. 447000000000</label><br>
        <input type="text" name="to">
        </p>

        <p>
        <label>Text message</label><br>
        <textarea name="text"> </textarea>
        </p>
        <button type="submit">Send text</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

The above code adds a form with inputs for a phone number and a message, and once the form is submitted, it will send a `POST` request to `/send`. Notice the Leaf block starting with `#if(status):`. It checks for a value for the status variable, and if set, it will add the additional status information. If you build and run (CMD + R), you will now see your updated page.

## Create the Model Structs

A benefit of using Vapor is that you can lean on the Swift language's type-safety. You can model inputs and outputs to your server using 
 that conform to the `Codable` protocol; Vapor has a protocol called `Content` for this. 

Create a struct called `Input` that conforms to `Content` at the bottom of the `routes.swift` file:

```swift
struct Input: Content {
    let to: String
    let text: String
    let from = "SwiftText"
    var apiKey: String?
    var apiSecret: String?

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case to
        case text
        case from
        case apiKey = "api_key"
        case apiSecret = "api_secret"
    }
}
```

The Vonage SMS API expects fields in snake case, so the structs have the `CodingKeys` enum to map their property names to their snake case equivalent. Below the `Input` struct, create another struct for the response that the SMS API expects:

```swift
struct Response: Content {
    let messages: [Messages]

    struct Messages: Content {
        let status: String
    }
}
```

## Send the SMS

To send the SMS you need to make a call to the `/sms` endpoint of the Vonage SMS API. To do this, you need to define the `/send` route used by the web form, parse the form data, and then make the call. Start by defining the new route in the `routes` function:

```swift
app.post("send") { req -> EventLoopFuture<View> in
    var input = try req.content.decode(Input.self)
    input.apiKey = Environment.get("APIKEY")
    input.apiSecret = Environment.get("APISECRET")
}
```

This uses the form body to create an `Input` struct, then the API key and secret are added from the `.env` file as they are required fields by the SMS API. Next, you will use Vapor's [Client API](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/client/), which allows you to make external HTTP calls, to call the SMS API. Add the call to the send route:

```swift
app.post("send") { req -> EventLoopFuture<View> in
    var input = try req.content.decode(Input.self)
    input.apiKey = Environment.get("APIKEY")
    input.apiSecret = Environment.get("APISECRET")
    
    return req.client.post(URI(scheme: "https", host: "rest.nexmo.com", path: "/sms/json")) { req in
        try req.content.encode(input, as: .json)
    }.flatMap { response -> EventLoopFuture<View> in
        let responseBody = try! response.content.decode(Response.self)
        return req.view.render("index", ["status": responseBody.messages.first?.status == "0" ? "ok" : "error"])
    }
}
```

The `client.post` function call has a return type of `EventLoopFuture<ClientResponse>`. It then gets mapped into an `EventLoopFuture<View>` type, which is the route's expected return type.  The map function takes the SMS API response and creates a status variable for the view renderer to use in the `index.leaf` file.

## Try It Out

Build and run (CMD + R) the project, open `localhost:8080` in your browser, then fill in a phone number and a message.

![Index page of the project](/content/blog/how-to-send-sms-messages-with-swift-vapor-and-vonage/input.png "Index page of the project")

Clicking the *send* button will send the data to the route you defined earlier, make the call to the Vonage SMS API, and then return to the initial page with its status.

## What Next?

You can find the completed project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/swift-vapor-sms). 

You can do more with the SMS API, such as checking if your server successfully delivered an SMS. Learn about it on [our developer platform](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/overview).
