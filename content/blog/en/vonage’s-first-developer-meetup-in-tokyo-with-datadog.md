On February 15th, [Vonage](https://www.vonagebusiness.jp/developer-center/) collaborated with [Datadog Japan](https://www.datadoghq.com/ja/) for our first developers' meetup at [WeWork Tokyo Square Garden](https://weworkjpn.com/location/tokyo/marunouchi-nihonbashi-area/tokyo-square-garden/). Several developers, engineers, and startups from the communities were invited. The event was focused on introducing Vonage APIs and Datadog services. It was also a time to meet with developers and the [WeWork](https://weworkjpn.com/) community in Tokyo.

The meetup started with a talk by Vonage Sales Development Representative, Hiroya Yamaguchi. He presented an overview of [Vonage Communications-Platform-as-a-Service](https://www.vonagebusiness.jp/communications-apis/platform/).

The attendees talked about their projects, interests, and applications while learning about what we do during the event. It was a good networking session with delicious tacos sponsored by [WeWork Japan](https://twitter.com/WeWorkJP) and a colour-matching fun time with [Vonage](https://www.vonagebusiness.jp/developer-center/) and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/ja/) socks.
