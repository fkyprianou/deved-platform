6 Soft Skills Every Technical Person Should Have in 2023 & Beyond

## Introduction

You've spent countless hours in lectures, taking tests, and finally landed your dream technical job, only to discover that you will also need soft skills to succeed. But where do you start, and more importantly, what soft skills should you focus on in 2023 and beyond? Today, I'll take you on a journey of soft skills that I'm personally focusing on and provide real-world examples that you can start today to build relationships, work effectively in your team, and contribute to a positive work culture that lasts generations.

## Communication

Communication is a core skill set in all soft skills, no matter the list. Communication is the foundation of solid relationships that allows you to build trust, resolve conflicts, and strengthen your connections with others. It is easier to exchange information and ideas and achieve common goals if you have them. 

Making eye contact and having upbeat body language and tone can make an impact no matter who you talk to. It is contagious. Try arriving at a meeting with a positive attitude, no matter the task. I've also found that giving a clear and concise update in three bullet points ensures that it is easily read and digested and can be copied into other communication methods such as emails, Slack, instant messaging applications, etc. Finally, I recommend having a team "lunch and learn" and putting together a slide deck explaining a feature, product, etc. By doing so, you'll learn more about the program as you plan to explain it to others and be regarded as someone who wants to share it with their team.

## Leadership

An effective leader inspires and motivates others to work towards achieving a common goal. They also set a clear vision and strategy on how to get there. People often confuse the term management with leadership. A company or organization typically appoints management, whereas a leader doesn't need an official position to demonstrate this.

You can become an effective leader by trusting your team when you ask them to do something. Give them a chance to complete the task first before following up. Also, take time to understand your team's strengths and weaknesses and assign work accordingly. If you have someone on your team who loves documentation vs. coding, let them do it! It is straightforward to motivate someone if the work aligns with what they are passionate about. Finally, lean on others when making a decision that impacts them. You aren't in this alone, and selecting or delaying a decision can cause confusion.

## Interpersonal Skill

Interpersonal Skill is a list of abilities related to working with others. They typically include teamwork and intercultural fluency, such as understanding the impact of one's actions and words on others. A person that practices self-awareness looks to understand and shares the feelings of others and can identify and resolve disputes constructively. It only takes a little explaining to understand why you'd need this in the workplace! 

I'd start by "lightening up" to start working better with other people. While taking your job seriously, you should also know when to have fun and laugh. This will also help reduce burnout, which is relevant in our industry. I'd also suggest ways to get better at giving constructive criticism versus just saying that "it is all wrong." Take time to understand why they did it that way. Was there some information that was missing that would have helped them? Finally, learn to be assertive but not aggressive in your asks or comments. By becoming assertive, we show confidence in our asks vs. demanding. 

## Mentorship

Mentorship is someone who teaches or gives help and advice to a less experienced and often younger person. There are several reasons you want to become a mentor with the first is that you can grow others on the team - not just yourself. It also offers a self-reflection opportunity on your career as you prepare to advise your mentee. It can also be used on your performance review to grow your career since you take the time to develop others. 

I have been both a mentor and a mentee, and before I was a mentor, I would read books or articles on the topic to gain insights into what a great mentor looks like. One book I'd recommend is "Mentoring 101" by John C. Maxwell. I'd also spend time becoming an advocate for less experienced developers (or teammates), and they might come to you for more formal mentorship. Finally, you must have the desire to help someone reach their potential - even if that means putting yourself second to elevate them. 

## Problem-solving

Problem-solving is essential because it helps individuals and organizations identify and resolve issues and challenges promptly and effectively. An excellent problem-solver allows you to solve problems effectively, leading to a sense of accomplishment and increased job satisfaction.

One quick way to start being a problem-solver is to look for a way to move the project forward (even if it means putting it off). It can be a simple status email with the following steps to take or current blockers or pulling in another teammate to give it a fresh set of eyes. You can also look at your current tasks from various "lenses" before making the decision. This is where it is helpful to pull in others to achieve a common goal. 

## Conflict management

Conflict management is vital because conflicts and disagreements are a natural part of human interaction. By dealing with conflict management appropriately, you can help build trust and strengthen relationships within a team, fostering a sense of collaboration and community.

I typically look for common ground and helpful solutions when presented with a conflict. Very rarely is only one person right in a conflict. You should also ensure that conflict is appropriately and productively resolved. Never let a conflict go unaddressed or unresolved. Work to ensure all parties understand the conflict and the proposed resolution.


## Wrap-up

We've only scratched the surface of several soft skills that you should have in 2023 and beyond. Several honorable mentions are: 

* Networking - This is a way for individuals to grow their professional or personal lives by building a network of people working in the same industry as they do. This is beneficial for several reasons, with someone to reach out to in case they need a job being the first. 
* Public Speaking -  Some people fear public speaking, but I typically use it as a motivator to learn something well enough to explain it to others. While you don't have to do it in a conference setting, the skillset translates to running internal meetings or organizing your thoughts. 
* Time Management - Do you sometimes feel like you can't get anything done? I'd suggest creating a prioritized to-do list with 3 "must-do" items for the day, regardless of how little (or big) they might be. Setting clear and attainable goals gives you something to work towards, and checking an item off gives you a sense of accomplishment. 

By learning these Soft skills, you'll show your future employer that your education and technical abilities are just the start of the skillset they will acquire when they hire you.
