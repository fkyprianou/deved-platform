On 26th October 2022 an awesome group of developers and friends descended on Dabbers Social Bingo for the inaugural DevCity London event, hosted by the Vonage Developer Relations Team. It was an action packed night of content, networking and fun and we want to say a huge thank you to everyone who joined us - we loved meeting you! Didn’t make it? Read on to find out how it went…


## We Delivered Content

At the start of the evening we welcomed some of Team Vonage to the stage to tell guests more about what we do, with Chris Tankersley kicking us off with a warm welcome and a general overview of the Vonage APIs. Chris was then joined by special guest Laurence Bargery, CTO of Accurx, to discuss how they are using our client SDK for in-app Voice application as a pilot project. They handed the mic over to Vonage’s Zachary Powell and Ashley Arthur, who shared how Vonage moved its Client SDKs to Kotlin MultiPlatform and saved the world (kind of).
