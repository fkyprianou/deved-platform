Hey everyone! I’m Michael Crump and I’m very excited to be joining the Developer Relations Team at Vonage as a Developer Advocate located in Washington state. I will be focused on Vonage's Communication APIs (such as Messaging, Voice, and Video) to help developers discover, implement, and succeed with our APIs. 

I’ve been a Developer Advocate in some way, shape, or form since 2011 when I started at Telerik through my previous employer which was Microsoft. I spent the majority of my career working with Microsoft technologies (such as .NET, XAML, ASP.NET) to JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js. But that hasn’t stopped me from spending time with Python and the Go Language. 

The thing that I enjoy the most about being in advocacy is the developer community and seeing someone “get it” when a concept is understood or a code snippet is shared that gets a developer over a hump. I also love the two-way communication that happens as we share best practices and methods to become even better in our professions. Throughout my years, the community has taught me all kinds of new things and I have a lot to be thankful about. 

On a personal front, I love reading books (from fiction to nonfiction) and hanging out with my family on the lake. I also enjoy video gaming (lots of retro consoles like PS2 and Gamecube) and console hardware security. 

If you’d like to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbcrump), please do so, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. I’m still learning but can find the answer regardless of what programming language you choose. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I’ll talk to you soon.
