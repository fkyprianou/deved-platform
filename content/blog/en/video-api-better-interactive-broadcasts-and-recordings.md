## Vonage multiparty video reaches 5,000 live interactive participants, improving interactive broadcast quality, layouts and recording

Wait no more! We’ve been working hard on improving interactive broadcasts with more participant streams (up to 5,000 REAL TIME participants!), as well as improvements to on screen layouts and overall video quality of interactive broadcasts and recordings. 

The Vonage Video API has long offered the ability to compose video layouts for broadcasting and recording in real-time as the video conversation occurs, rather than relaying the stream to a post-processing service with a much higher latency and lacking interactivity.

The real-time [interactive broadcasts](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/broadcast/live-interactive-video/) combined with composed cloud [recordings](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/archiving/) has been a favorite use case on virtual events and education platforms last year.

## Broadcast Interactive

Virtual events companies grew like mushrooms last year as organizations needed smart ways to securely connect people with events and enable them to take part, whether in person or virtually. A virtual event typically combines a live stream with audience participation. This interactive element helps maximize opportunities for member engagement and meeting attendance, whether members are attending in person or online.

2020 demonstrated that anyone could benefit from attending a virtual event. Remote events, when done thoughtfully, can be very effective. The purpose-built experience allows for specialized stage environments with text-based audience interactions like Q&A and voting, while the breakout rooms allow for networking and open exchange of ideas.  

The move to virtual services during the last year has necessitated rapid digital transformation. Virtual town halls became one of the trademark features of corporate and civic organizations attempting to stay in touch with their people.

*“With Vonage’s Video API, we are able to keep users within our ecosystem, allowing us to ensure that both local authority employees and members of the public can join meetings, communicate, and view secure and easily accessible information from any device.” - Steven Garratt, CIVICA Modern.Gov.*

## Keeping Records

There are many reasons to commit video sessions to machine memory. Some work teams regularly record their team meetings to give everyone the benefit of the same piece of information. 

That is our practice here at Vonage, and we are not alone. Nearly 11% of  [Vonage Video API](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/video/) archival minutes come from our *business* customers leveraging the archiving feature for greater organizational transparency and compliance reasons. About 15% of recordings are generated by *[virtual events and gaming](https://www.vonage.com/resources/customers/crowdcast/)* - creating engaging on-demand content at live events, and another 18% share is with *[healthcare](https://www.vonage.com/about-us/vonage-stories/vonage-lowers-barriers-to-care/)* providers. Most archives - almost a half - are created by the *[EdTech](https://www.vonage.com/resources/articles/changing-course-video-distance-learning/)* providers to record group lectures and tutoring sessions.

## These Times, They Call for... *More*

As with the rest of our lives, the global pandemic impacted our use of video, be it broadcasting or recording. As more of your customers are joining video sessions, these sessions got longer with more participants and with various devices - the recordings and broadcasts needed to keep up, too! The world our platform was initially designed for has changed, and we threw ourselves into identifying the features most needed to keep up. 

### More Interactive Participants

In a [live interactive video broadcast](https://www-tbdev.tokbox.com/developer/guides/broadcast/live-interactive-video/), a large number of clients can communicate in real time by publishing and subscribing to each others' streams in the session. The recent platform update increased the number of live interactive participants supported in a video broadcast session, up to 5,000 - depending on the number of active publishers in the session.

For example, when there are 1 or 2 published streams in the session, up to 5,000 participants can view both of these published streams with real-time latency as live broadcast participants. Similarly, when there are 3 or 4 published streams in the session, up to 4,000 participants can view all 3 or 4 published streams.

Learn more about the new limits and how to build your app to support interactive broadcasts in our [Live interactive broadcasts developer guide](https://www-tbdev.tokbox.com/developer/guides/broadcast/live-interactive-video/).


### More Video and Audio Participant in Composed Views

In a recent platform update, we increased the maximum number of video and audio streams viewable in [a composed recording](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/archiving/#individual-stream-and-composed-archives) or a [composed live streaming broadcast](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/broadcast/live-streaming/) for all customers. To accommodate more video participants and video streams in the composed layout, we increased the maximum number of supported video streams from 9 to 16. Similarly, we increased the number of audio-only participants from 9 to 50 total participants in recordings and broadcasts.

For example, our Best Fit layout type will automatically increase to a 4x4 grid layout, and customers have the option of customizing it to display up to 16 video streams. For audio, the first 50 audio streams published to the session will be included in the recordings and broadcasts.

### Longer Recordings With Better Sound Quality

The [Vonage Video Recording API](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/archiving/) has been updated to double the maximum video recording time to 240min so users can record longer meetings and video sessions. Automatic recording sessions will restart recording at 4hr length files. Additionally, audio in the recorded files and broadcasts is now recorded at a higher bitrate, MP4 files encoded with AAC at 128kbps, allowing higher fidelity audio to benefit application use cases.  

### Enhanced Screen Share Layouts and Stream Prioritization

The Video API allows users the flexibility to [customize the video layout](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/archiving/layout-control.html) and even dynamically change the video layout while [recording](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/archiving/layout-control.html#changing-layout-type) or [broadcasting](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/broadcast/live-streaming/#changing-layout-type).  

The new [Screen Share Layouts](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/archive-broadcast-layout/#screen-sharing-layouts) prioritize screenshare streams so that the user’s presentation or content share always takes precedence in the recording or broadcast. Customers can use this feature and [Layout Stream Prioritization Rules](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/archive-broadcast-layout/#stream-prioritization-rules) to make sure presentations, screen shares, and selected streams get priority in recordings and broadcasts.

### Portrait Layout 

As people adapt to their remote environments, we also saw the need to support vertical compositions suitable for mobile devices in portrait orientation. To that end, we added support for portrait layout resolutions, portrait SD (480x640) and portrait HD (720x1280) for both recording and interactive broadcasting. Our predefined layouts have been optimized for these portrait orientations to adapt automatically for mobile orientation views.

### Cloud Recording and Broadcast Quality

Lastly, we also updated our video platform with a number of optimizations at our real-time cloud composition servers to improve video synchronization and resilience of real-time composed recordings and broadcasts under poor network conditions. These improvements ensure that sessions are recorded or live streamed properly, even when publishers find themselves in adverse network conditions.

## Privacy, Please

When it comes to video broadcasts and recordings, privacy and security related features may be required. Vonage Video API already comes with always-on encryption and other features designed to protect users' information. With [encryption](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/archiving/opentok-encryption.html), customers can ensure that their recorded data can be stored securely to maintain user privacy and comply with regulations, like GDPR. Learn more about Vonage [Video API privacy architecture](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/video/video-api-privacy-architecture/) and how it protects your users and your content.

## Getting Started

We are very excited to put the power of improved broadcasting and recording into the hands of our customers to ensure they can keep up with today’s communications demands. The features are already available in the [Vonage Video API](https://tokbox.com/account/) Standard and Enterprise environments so customers can gain immediate access to these improved capabilities.
