## What is Spotlight for Donations?
Spotlight for Donations is a new program that offers more options to people interested in creating content for Vonage's Developer Spotlight program.

Interested in contributing to the program? [Apply today!](https://developer.nexmo.com/spotlight) We are looking for authors to contribute and become a part of our developer community. If you have built something using one or many of our APIs, then write about it!

And now, authors can choose to donate their $500 payout to a tech-focused charity.

Teach others and grow as an author while supporting tech-focused nonprofits and charities doing important work in the industry.

Dev Spotlight authors play an active role in growing our library of tutorials on innovative ways to use our APIs.

## Pay It Forward

Any time you share your knowledge with others, you're doing a service to the community. But now you can pay it forward in more ways than one. When you help us build our API-driven community by contributing a tutorial, helping your fellow developers learn and grow, you can choose to donate your $500 payment to a charity making a difference in the technology industry.

Our Spotlight for Donations program is the same as the regular Developer Spotlight program; the only difference is where the money goes. We’ve curated a list of tech-focused nonprofits you can choose from; at this time we don’t have the ability to donate to any nonprofits not on our list, but we hope we’ve collected a wide enough variety that there’s something you can feel good about supporting.

The choice is yours, and anonymous, so don’t second guess yourself. If you’re a young programmer working hard to make a living, let us pay you for your work. If you’re a veteran working at a large company, where perhaps you don’t have the option to write for payment? Donate it instead!

Whatever you choose, our goal remains the same: to give something back to the community. We want to give you a moment in the spotlight and, if you so choose, we want to help you support a worthy cause. Either way, we’re building a library of top-quality tutorials to inspire other developers with innovative uses of our APIs, and we need your input.

## Spotlight Charities

We have identified 14 tech-focused nonprofits that you may choose from if you choose to write your Spotlight for Donation. At this time we are unable to give to charities not on this list, but we hope we've found something everybody can feel good about supporting:
