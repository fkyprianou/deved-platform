Here at Vonage we are so excited to be partnering with Salesforce as an exclusive Innovator Sponsor for Dreamforce 2022. One of the most exciting and biggest tech events of the year, Dreamforce always promises to be action packed, and for all the devs attending - we’ve got you covered. 

Not attending Dreamforce this year? Read on, because you can still take part in some of the fun without the cost of a ticket… 

**Where can you find us?**

Those familiar with Dreamforce know to head to the Campground to visit stands and collect swag from a huge range of innovators from all over the world, so be sure to check out the **Vonage Stand** there as your first port of call - number 1107. Meet the team, experience API demos, book a meeting with us or chat to us about potential API use cases. Here you can also collect exclusive Vonage swag - including the opportunity to design your own personalised backpack (don’t miss the developer friendly add on). And that’s not even all - ever wanted to be a hologram? Now's your chance.

Looking for the true Developer experience? Head to the Trailblazer section and visit the **Vonage Kiosk** to unlock an exclusive shirt designed for our Dev friends. Again here you can chat to one of the team about what we can do with our APIs, watch a demo and get your hands on our swag. 

At both of these locations you can get on the list for the **Vonage Hub** - the real place to be for API innovation and discovery. Plus, you can skip the monster food queues at the event and join us for super tasty snack in quick time. Based on the 3rd floor of the nearby InterContinental Hotel, at the Hub you can network, relax, collect your personalized bag, unlock even more great swag and perhaps even spot your hologram. Plus, each day Vonage Senior Dev Relations Engineer Chris Tankersley will be running a live workshop to help you get going with Vonage APIs. Stay tuned for dates, times and topics. No Dreamforce ticket? The Hub is free for all to attend and enjoy so come on down. 

Finally don’t miss the **Vonage Party**, the best way to get your night started before Dreamfest - the mega Dreamforce event party. Join us at the Vonage Hub for good music, great drinks and network with some of the best folk around (maybe we’re biased).  

**Which sessions can I attend?**

Below are the details of the sessions that our team is running at the Vonage Hub, hosted by Chris Tankersley, Senior PHP Developer Advocate at Vonage. Remember, you don't need a Dreamforce ticket to join us! Refreshments will be served too. 

* Adding Video to your Website - Tuesday September 20th, 1:00pm-1:30pm
* Programmable Voice with Vonage - Wednesday September 21st, 1:30pm-2:00pm
* Vonage Number Insights - Thursday September 22nd, 11:30pm-12:00pm

**What’s in it for me?**

Besides bundles of great swag, unlimited networking opportunities and free to access workshops and demos, anyone who registers for a free Vonage API Developer account at any of our three locations is automatically entered into a raffle to win a pair of RayBan Stories - their first generation smart wear technology. Terms and conditions apply. You can also unlock $10 free credit for your API account, to get your started with our products.

Sound good? See you there! You can find out more and read about how the rest of the Vonage universe is getting involved at Dreamforce [here](< https://www.vonage.com/events/Dreamforce2022/>).
