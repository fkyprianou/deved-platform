## Introduction

[Proactive Connect](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/proactive-connect/) enters open beta availability, which means you can begin trying it right now from the [Vonage Developer Portal](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/).

Proactive Connect makes it easy for those unacquainted to create large-scale outreach campaigns using multiple Vonage Communications APIs, including SMS, Messages, Voice, and with AI Studio. This new API allows you to schedule and send personalized messages, across multiple channels, to different large-scale contact groups. It offers the ability to receive and act on customer responses in a friendly Vonage Dashboard user interface.
