Virtual technical conferences always seemed to make perfect sense. Who better than a bunch of technologists to find a way to deliver the content and conversations of a traditional professional conference, without the difficulty of travel, or the overhead of seating and feeding thousands of attendees? And yet, for years tech conferences were primarily in-person events. 

When the pandemic triggered worldwide lockdowns in March of 2020, the tech industry was challenged to determine if it had a viable model for virtual conferences, and if an appaetite for them existed. This has meant an explosion of conference platforms, and the emergence of competing schools of thought about things almost no one had even considered before. It meant we could try and hold our tech communities together at times when we couldn't even see our families, and it meant learning what parts of tech conferences we genuinely value.

As someone who's been attending and speaking at tech conferences for over a decade, I was curious what the pandemic had taught us about virtual events. I solicited others' impressions, and the lack of response I got was my first lesson. 

## Low Engagement

It's pretty understandable that a deadly pandemic, and all the other major events of the past two years, distracted people. It may be that attending a tech conference just felt too much like pretending things were normal. Whatever the reason, I didn't hear a lot about people attending conferences. The conferences I took part in had low participation. Overall, my impression is that the move online wasn't a success.

However, I think it would be a mistake to believe that's the end of the story. Nothing seems inherently bad about virtual conferences. What seems questionable is that people would benefit from a virtual conference in the same way they benefit from in-person ones.

Other platforms that host learning content and conversation are thriving. Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok aren't restrained by not being able to replicate the experience of in-person learning. People regularly post tutorials on those platforms that are not dissimilar to a tech conference talk in their intent, and find not only interest, but engagement. 

Most virtual conferences I've attended seemed to start with the assumption that they should mimic an in-person conference. But that doesn't seem to work. Can we do better if we pull apart the idea of a conference and consider how to make the most of a virtual venue?

## Elements of a Conference

A lot of what goes into a traditional conference isn't needed when it's virtual. If you're on the organizing end, it might be tempting to write off catering, hotels, or afterparties as logistical overhead. But I think the past two years have shown that not having those secondary elements that give a conference atmosphere puts a lot of pressure on the remaining pieces of the experience. 

### The Talks

There are so many ways that talks at a virtual conference need to meet a higher bar. They need to be fascinating topics. They need to be well-practiced and impeccably delivered. Better yet, they need to be prerecorded, and meet the same standard of a video course someone might pay for (because that's essentially what they are). Don't believe me? Consider how easy it is to switch to another tab "just for a second" and come back to find the conference is on a lunch break. 

Holding a conference online is like holding it in Times Square. The competing demands on participants' attention are unrelenting. If people have come for the talks, my experience is that "Local Web Dev Introduces React Hooks" won't cut it as a topic. If the talks are the center of a virtual conference, the names need to be big, the projects need to be life-altering, and the technology needs to be bleeding edge. 

As with all the rest of this, I think the pressure on talk quality begs the question: did this ever _really_ work? Was "Local Web Dev Introduces React Hooks" _always_ just filler? 

There are a few clear lessons about talks. First, prerecorded talks are so much safer. The speaker isn't going to be able to participate in any meaningful way while giving a live talk, and trying to gauge the audience's reaction in real time is likely to trip them up. Prerecorded talks don't experience connectivity issues or screensharing hiccups. They have the added advantage of allowing simultaneous Q&A, truly taking advantage of the medium.
