As a beacon of code and a big fan of summer, I've been exploring ways to mix enjoying the season with a bit of coding. The sun is out, and here are some hot apps you can build to pair with your favorite summer activities.

## Have Some Ice Cream with Your IDE


1. **Hydration Manager**: Thirst isn't always a reliable early indicator of the body's need for water. Many people don't feel thirsty until they're already dehydrated. To make sure you stay hydrated this summer, you can build an app using the Vonage Messages API that sends friendly reminders to drink up! Here's a [blog](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/drinking-water-reminder-app-with-node-react-and-vonage-messages-api) on how to create that app.

2. **UV Index Forecaster**: After experiencing a couple of painful sunburns, I've learned that the UV index is not just a number but a crucial health indicator. It is a scale from 0 to 11+ that measures the sun's intensity which can cause skin damage and cancer when exposed without protection. Being aware of UV radiation levels can help you better plan your outdoor activities and take the right measures such as wearing sunscreen, sunglasses, and protective clothing.

TL;DR _wear sunscreen_ and build an app with the [OpenUV API](https://www.openuv.io/) that provides real-time information about UV radiation levels, encouraging users to be sun smart!

3. **Camping Companion**: Living in Colorado, I'm spoiled with numerous camp sites. Using the [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm), a camping app that provides camping recipes, safety information, and a checklist for camping gear would make any novice camper feel like a pro.

4. **Grill Guru**: Who doesn't love grilling in summer? An app using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) would not only suggest delicious grill recipes but also throw in a few summer drink ideas to quench that summer thirstâ€“just make sure to stay hydrated with water (See 1).

5. **Air Quality Tracker**: Some summers, I feel like I'm allergic to the air. But with an air quality tracker app using the [Breezometer API](https://breezometer.com/), users can get insights about air quality, nearby wildfires, and pollen - helping them plan their day better and receiving insights about the cleanest route to take.

6. **Climbing Journal**: I am not a runner. *The only running I do is from my problems*. So I was happy to find an alternative cardio workout: rock climbing! A recent [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26247548/) even indicates it could help with lower back pain. This study shows that climbing can serve as a cheaper alternative to physical therapy. By using the [OpenBeta API](https://openbeta.io/), you can create an app to find climbing routes and share experiences and tips with fellow climbers.

7. **Personal Fitness Coach**: Need that big brain energy? Exercise has been proven to improve brain function because it stimulates the production of chemicals in the brain that helps brain cells and blood vessels grow and survive. Build an app using the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/) to create personalized training plans as a fantastic motivator for anyone wanting to stay active and improve their memory and thinking skills this summer.

8. **Plant Parent App**: As a proud (though horrible) plant parent, I've had my fair share of plant blunders. An app built with the [Perenual API](https://perenual.com/docs/api) would save many plants by giving advice on care, sunlight requirements, and much more.

9. **Geocaching Guide**: Geocaching is a high-tech global treasure hunt that involves problem-solving and exploring the outdoors. Players locate hidden containers, or "geocaches," using GPS coordinates. An app built with the [Groundspeak API](https://api.groundspeak.com/documentation#intro) would add to the excitement by allowing platers to uncover new locations, share their finds, and engage with others in the geocaching community.

10. **3D Printing Pal**: Ever since I discovered a local makerspace, I've been fascinated by 3D printing. Using the [Thingiverse API](https://www.thingiverse.com/developers), you can build a 3D customization app where users can add text, change dimensions, or combine multiple designs, then upload their projects for other makers to try to recreate.
