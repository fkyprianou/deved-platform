We are happy to announce that *Nexmo Client SDKs have moved from Developer Preview to Beta!*

With [Nexmo's Client SDKs](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/overview) you can create an omnichannel communication experience for your customers in your Javascript, Android and iOS applications, while retaining context across different channels—including voice and messaging.

## What's in This Version?

### Real-time Communication

With today’s fast-paced lifestyle and expected high standard of service, performant real-time communication is a must.

In addition to in-app messaging, we’ve improved and extended rich in-app voice and phone calls (PSTN) capabilities, added media control in multi-member conversation, improved call statuses and more.

### Performant Communication

Using the Nexmo Client SDKs saves you the heavy lifting of managing, syncing and storing the numerous events that occur during a conversation. We’re committed to keeping you and your customers connected in the easiest, most efficient and quickest way, so that you can focus on the things that matter the most - your customers and business.

We've made many performance and API improvements that enable a great developer experience, which in turn enables the creation of great user experiences.

### Enhanced Communication

We know that your relationship with your customers, and the way you communicate with them, is unique so we're continuously shaping the Nexmo platform and products to be robust and flexible for your needs.

In the latest releases, we've introduced the ability to add [custom events](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/custom-events) into a conversation.

These can be anything you like, but some examples of custom events would be: a payment was made, a gift was sent, a promo code was applied, and anything you can imagine. Essentially, this allows you to integrate your own channels into the conversation.

In parallel, we continue to add more communication channels, and soon you’ll be able to find video, SMS and other channels that integrate the powerful Nexmo APIs.

## What's Next?

We encourage you to upgrade the SDKs versions. Release notes are available for [Javascript](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/sdk-documentation/javascript/release-notes), [Android](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/sdk-documentation/android/release-notes) and [iOS](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/sdk-documentation/ios/release-notes).

Or [get started](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/setup/add-sdk-to-your-app) with out setup guide, if you haven't already.

*Thank you* to all the developers and partners who took part in the developer preview phase, provided valuable feedback, and created great experiences for their users.

We're looking forward to continuing to build meaningful, seamless, omnichannel conversations together with you all.
