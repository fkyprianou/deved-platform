Today we will build an Android application using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and utilize Vonage Client SDK to make a call from a mobile application to the phone.  The application will have 3 screens (3 UI states):

![UI states](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/ui-states.png)

## Prerequisites

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-voice-app-to-phone-flutter).

Before we begin building the application for our Android device, you'll need to prepare with the following prerequisites:

* Create a Call Control Object ([NCCO](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/guides/ncco))
* Install Nexmo CLI
* Setup Vonage application
* Install Flutter SDK
* Create a Flutter project

## Vonage Application

### Create An NCCO

A Call Control Object (NCCO) is a JSON array that we use to control the flow of a Voice API call. More information on NCCO can be found here [here](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference).

The NCCO needs to be public and accessible by the internet. To accomplish this, in this tutorial you'll be using [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) which provides a convenient way to host the configuration. Let's add a new gist:

1. Go to <https://gist.github.com/> (you have to be logged in into Github)
2. Create a new gist with `ncco.json` the as filename
3. Copy and paste the following JSON object into the gist:

```json
[
    {
        "action": "talk",
        "text": "Please wait while we connect you."
    },
    {
        "action": "connect",
        "endpoint": [
            {
                "type": "phone",
                "number": "PHONE_NUMBER"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

4. Replace `PHONE_NUMBER` with our phone number (Vonage numbers are in E.164 format <https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/glossary#e-164-format>, '+' and '-' are not valid. Make sure we specify our country code when entering our number, for example, US: 14155550100 and UK: 447700900001)
5. Click the `Create secret gist` button
6. Click the `Raw` button
7. Take note of the URL shown in our browser, we will be using it in the next step

### Install Nexmo CLI

The [Nexmo CLI](https://developer.nexmo.com/application/nexmo-cli) allows us to carry out many operations on the command line. If we want to carry out tasks such as creating applications, purchasing Vonage numbers and so on, we will need to install the Nexmo CLI.

Nexmo CLI requires `node.js`, so we will need to install node.js first using [these instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To install the Beta version of the CLI with NPM run this command:

```cmd
npm install nexmo-cli@beta -g
```

Set up the Nexmo CLI to use our Vonage API Key and API Secret. we can get these from the [settings page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) in the Dashboard.

Run the following command in a terminal, while replacing api_key and api_secret with our own:

```cmd
nexmo setup api_key api_secret
```

### Setup Vonage Application

1. Create our project directory if you've not already done so, run the following command in our terminal:

```cmd
mkdir vonage-tutorial
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```cmd
cd vonage-tutorial
```

3. Create a Vonage application by copying and pasting the command below into the terminal Make sure to change the value of `--voice-answer-url` argument by replacing `GIST-URL` with the gist URL from the previous step.

```
nexmo app:create "App to Phone Tutorial" --capabilities=voice --keyfile=private.key --voice-event-url=https://example.com/ --voice-answer-url=GIST-URL
```

Make a note of the Application ID that is echoed in our terminal when our application is created.

> NOTE: A hidden file named `.nexmo-app` is created in our project directory and contains the newly created Vonage Application ID and the private key. A private key file named `private.key` is also created.

### Create User

Each participant is represented by a [User](https://developer.nexmo.com/conversation/concepts/user) object and must be authenticated by the Client SDK. In a production application, we would typically store this user information in a database.

Execute the following command to create a user called `Alice`

```cmd
nexmo user:create name="Alice"
```

### Generate JWT

The JWT is used to authenticate the user. Execute the following command in the terminal to generate a JWT for the user `Alice`.

In the following command replace the `APPLICATION_ID` with the ID of our application:

```
nexmo jwt:generate sub=Alice exp=$(($(date +%s)+86400)) acl='{"paths":{"/*/users/**":{},"/*/conversations/**":{},"/*/sessions/**":{},"/*/devices/**":{},"/*/image/**":{},"/*/media/**":{},"/*/applications/**":{},"/*/push/**":{},"/*/knocking/**":{},"/*/legs/**":{}}}'
```

The command above sets the expiry of the JWT to one day from now, which is the maximum.

Make a note of the JWT we generated for `Alice`.

> NOTE: In a production environment, our application should expose an endpoint that generates a JWT for each client request.

## Install Android Studio

Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Flutter Setup

### Install Flutter SDK

This step will vary on MacOS, Win, and Linux, but in general, it boils down to downloading flutter SDK for a given OS, extracting the SDK file, and adding the `sdk\bin` folder to the system PATH variable. Detailed instruction can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Fortunately, flutter comes with a tool that allows us to verify if SDK and all required "components" are present and configured correctly. Run this command:

```cmd
flutter doctor
```

Flutter Doctor will verify if Flutter SDK is installed and other components are installed and configured correctly. If problems will be detected we will see the description and hint regarding the fix.

### Install the Flutter Plugin

Open [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), go to `Preferences | plugins` and Install Flutter and Dart plugins from the marketplace. 

Flutter plugin will add a new toolbar that allows to run and debug Flutter application:

![flutter-plugin-ui](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/flutter-plugin-ui.png)

## Create the Flutter Project

You will create a Flutter project using Android Studio. 

* Run Android Studio
* On the Android Studio welcome screen select `Create New Flutter project`

![create-new-flutter-project](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/create-new-flutter-project.png)

* Select `Flutter Application` and click `Next`
* Enter `app_to_phone_flutter` as project name, enter `Flutter SDK path` and click `Next`
* Select `Include Kotlin support for Android code` and click `Finish`

> Notice that `app_to_phone_flutter` folder (flutter project) contains`ios` folder containing the OS project and `ios` folder containing the iOS project.

Connect Android device or emulator and run the app to verify that everything works as expected.

## Two-way Flutter/Android Communication

Currently, Client SDK is not available as a Flutter package, so we will have to use [Android native Client SDK](https://developer.nexmo.com/client-sdk/setup/add-sdk-to-your-app/android) and communicate between Android and Flutter using [MethodChannel](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/MethodChannel-class.html) - this way, Flutter will call Android methods, Android will call Flutter methods. 

Flutter code will be stored in the `lib/ain.dart` file, while Android native code will be stored in the `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/app_to_phone_flutter/MainActivity.kt` file.

## Init Flutter Application

Flutter applications are built using a programming language called [Dart](https://dart.dev/).

Open `lib/main.dart` file, and replace all of the contents with the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: CallWidget(title: 'app-to-phone-flutter'),
    );
  }
}

class CallWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  CallWidget({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);
  final String title;

  @override
  _CallWidgetState createState() => _CallWidgetState();
}

class _CallWidgetState extends State<CallWidget> {
  SdkState _sdkState = SdkState.LOGGED_OUT;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            SizedBox(height: 64),
            _updateView()
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget _updateView() {
    if (_sdkState == SdkState.LOGGED_OUT) {
      return ElevatedButton(
          child: Text("LOGIN AS ALICE")
      );
    }
  }

  Future<void> _loginUser() async {
      // Login user
  }

  Future<void> _makeCall() async {
      // Make call
  }

  Future<void> _endCall() async {
      // End call
  }
}

enum SdkState {
  LOGGED_OUT,
  LOGGED_IN,
  WAIT,
  ON_CALL,
  ERROR
}
```

The above code contains custom `CallWidget` which will be responsible for managing the application state (logging the user and managing the call). The `SdkState` enum represents possible states of Vonage Client SDK. This enum will be defined twice - one for Flutter using Dart and one for Android using Kotlin. The widget contains the `_updateView` method that will change the UI based on `SdkState` value.

Run the application using the green arrow button on the Flutter toolbar: 

![Run the app](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/run-the-app.png)

We should see the `Login Alice` button:

![An example of the screen when the user is logged out](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/loggedout.png)

### Login Screen

The `Login as Aice` button is disabled so now add `onPressed` handler to the `ElevatedButton` to allow logging in:

```dart
Widget _updateView() {
    if (_sdkState == SdkState.LOGGED_OUT) {
      return ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () { _loginUser(); },
          child: Text("LOGIN AS ALICE")
      );
    }
  }
```

Update body of `_loginUser` method to communicate with native code and login the user:

```dart
Future<void> _loginUser() async {
    String token = "ALICE_TOKEN";

    try {
      await platformMethodChannel.invokeMethod('loginUser', <String, dynamic>{'token': token});
    } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      print(e);
    }
  }
```

Replace the `ALICE_TOKEN` with the JWT token, we obtained previously, to authenticate the user `Alice` from Vonage CLI. Flutter will call `loginUser` method and pass the `token` as an argument. The `loginUser` method defined in the `MainActivity` class (you will get there in a moment). To call this method from Flutter we have to define a `MethodChannel`. Add the `platformMethodChannel` field at the top of `_CallWidgetState` class:

```dart
class _CallWidgetState extends State<CallWidget> {
  SdkState _sdkState = SdkState.LOGGED_OUT;
  static const platformMethodChannel = const MethodChannel('com.vonage');
```

The `com.vonage` string represents the unique channel id that we will also refers to the native Android code (`MainActivity` class). Now we need to handle this method call on the native Android side. 

Open `MainActivity` class. Note that the Flutter plugin displays a hint to open this Android project in the separate instance of Android Studio (another window). Do so to have better code completion for the Android project:

![Open In Android Studio](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/openinas.png)

> NOTE: This happens because the Flutter project consists of the Android project and the iOS project.

To listen for method calls originating from Flutter overide `configureFlutterEngine` and add `addFlutterChannelListener` method call inside `configureFlutterEngine` method:

```kotlin
override fun configureFlutterEngine(@NonNull flutterEngine: FlutterEngine) {
        super.configureFlutterEngine(flutterEngine)

        addFlutterChannelListener()
    }
```

Now add `addFlutterChannelListener` and `loginUser` methods inside the `MainActivity` class (same level as the above `configureFlutterEngine` method):

```kotlin
private fun addFlutterChannelListener() {
        MethodChannel(flutterEngine?.dartExecutor?.binaryMessenger, CHANNEL).setMethodCallHandler { call, result ->

            when (call.method) {
                "loginUser" -> {
                    val token = requireNotNull(call.argument<String>("token"))
                    loginUser(token)
                    result.success("")
                }
                else -> {
                    result.notImplemented()
                }
            }
        }
    }

private fun loginUser(token: String) {
        Log.d("TAG", "login with token: $token")
}
```

After running the application we should see `login with token...` message at Android Logcat. Now it's time to create a missing `client`. 

### Add Client SDK Dependency

Add a custom Maven URL repository to our Gradle configuration. Add the following maven block inside the `allprojects` block within the project-level `build.gradle.kts` file:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()

        maven {
            url "https://artifactory.ess-dev.com/artifactory/gradle-dev-local"
        }
    }
}
```

Now add the Client SDK dependency to the project in the `app\build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...

    implementation 'com.nexmo.android:client-sdk:2.8.1'
}
```

In the same file set min Android SDK version to `23`:

```groovy
minSdkVersion 23
```

Run `Sync project with Gradle` command in Android Studio, as shown in the example below:

![Sync project with Gradle](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/sync-projct-with-gradle.png)

### Initialize Client

Open `MainActivity` class and add the `client` property which will hold the reference to the Nexmo client:

```kotlin
private lateinit var client: NexmoClient
```

Now add `initClient` method to initialise the client:

```kotlin
private fun initClient() {
        client = NexmoClient.Builder().build(this)
    }
```

To call the `initClient` method from the existing the `configureFlutterEngine` method, we're going to need to add the `initClient()` line as shown in the example below:

```kotlin
override fun configureFlutterEngine(@NonNull flutterEngine: FlutterEngine) {
     super.configureFlutterEngine(flutterEngine)

    initClient()
    addFlutterChannelListener()
}
```

### Login The User

Modify `login` method body to call `login` on the client instance:

```kotlin
private fun login(token: String) {
    client.login(token)
}
```

This will allow us to log the user (`Alice`) in using Client SDK.

### Notify Flutter About Client SDK State Change

To notify Flutter of any changes to the state in the SDK, you'll need to add `enum` to represents the states of the client SDK. You've already added the equivalent `SdkState` enum in the `main.dart` file). Add the following`SdkState` enum, at the bottom of the `MainActivity.kt` file:

```kotlin
enum class SdkState {
    LOGGED_OUT,
    LOGGED_IN,
    WAIT,
    ON_CALL,
    ERROR
}
```

Next, we need to add the connection listener and map some of the SDK states to `SdkState` enum. Modify the body of the `initClient` method as shown in the example below:

```kotlin
private fun initClient() {
        client = NexmoClient.Builder().build(this)

        client.setConnectionListener { connectionStatus, _ ->
            when (connectionStatus) {
                ConnectionStatus.CONNECTED -> notifyFlutter(SdkState.LOGGED_IN)
                ConnectionStatus.DISCONNECTED -> notifyFlutter(SdkState.LOGGED_OUT)
                ConnectionStatus.CONNECTING -> notifyFlutter(SdkState.WAIT)
                ConnectionStatus.UNKNOWN -> notifyFlutter(SdkState.ERROR)
            }
        }
    }
```

Finally, the `notifyFlutter` method needs to be added to the `MainActivity` class:

```kotlin
private fun notifyFlutter(state: SdkState) {
        Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).post {
            MethodChannel(flutterEngine?.dartExecutor?.binaryMessenger, "com.vonage")
                .invokeMethod("updateState", state.toString())
        }
    }
```

Notice that we store the state in the enum, but we are sending it as a string. Communication with Flutter happens on the `main` thread, so we need to use `Handler` to switch threads. The `MethodChannel` will call `updateState` method defined in the `main.dart` file. 

### Retrieve SDK State By Flutter

To retrieve state updates in Flutter we have to listen for method channel updates. Open `main.dart` file and add these two methods inside `_CallWidgetState` class:

```dart
_CallWidgetState() {
    platformMethodChannel.setMethodCallHandler(methodCallHandler);
  }

Future<dynamic> methodCallHandler(MethodCall methodCall) async {
    switch (methodCall.method) {
      case 'updateState':
        {
          setState(() {
            var arguments = 'SdkState.${methodCall.arguments}';
            _sdkState = SdkState.values.firstWhere((v) {return v.toString() == arguments;}
            );
          });
        }
        break;
      default:
        throw MissingPluginException('notImplemented');
    }
  }
```

These methods receive the "signal" from Android and converts it to an enum. Now update the contents of the `_updateView` method to support `SdkState.WAIT` and `SdkState.LOGGED_IN` states, as shown in the example below:

```dart
Widget _updateView() {
    if (_sdkState == SdkState.LOGGED_OUT) {
      return ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () { _loginUser(); },
          child: Text("LOGIN AS ALICE")
      );
    }  else if (_sdkState == SdkState.WAIT) {
      return Center(
        child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
      );
    } else if (_sdkState == SdkState.LOGGED_IN) {
      return ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () { _makeCall(); },
          child: Text("MAKE PHONE CALL")
      );
    }
  }
```

During `SdkState.WAIT` the progress bar will be displayed. After successful login application will show the `MAKE PHONE CALL` button.

> NOTE: While modifying Android native code Flutter hot reload will not work. we have to stop the application and run it again.

Run the app and click the button labelled `LOGIN AS ALICE`. The `MAKE PHONE CALL` button should appear, which is another state of the Flutter app based on the `SdkState` enum`). An example of this is shown in the image below:

![Make a phone call](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/makeaphonecall.png)

### Make A Call

We now need to add functionality to make a phone call. Open the `main.dart` file and update the body of the `_makeCall` method as shown below:

```dart
Future<void> _makeCall() async {
    try {
      await requestPermissions();

      await platformMethodChannel
          .invokeMethod('makeCall');
    } on PlatformException catch (e) {
      print(e);
    }
  }
```

The above method will communicate with Android so we have to update the code in `MainActivity` class as well. Add `makeCall` clauses to `when` statement inside `addFlutterChannelListener` method:

```kotlin
private fun addFlutterChannelListener() {
        MethodChannel(flutterEngine?.dartExecutor?.binaryMessenger, "com.vonage").setMethodCallHandler { call, result ->

            when (call.method) {
                "loginUser" -> {
                    val token = requireNotNull(call.argument<String>("token"))
                    login(token)
                    result.success("")
                }
                "makeCall" -> {
                    makeCall()
                    result.success("")
                }
                else -> {
                    result.notImplemented()
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

Now in the same file add the `onGoingCall` property, which defines if and when a call is ongoing:

```kotlin
private var onGoingCall: NexmoCall? = null
```

> NOTE: Currently the Client SDK does not store ongoing call reference, so we have to store it in `MainActivity` class. we will use it later to end the call.

Now in the same file add `makeCall` method:

```kotlin
@SuppressLint("MissingPermission")
    private fun makeCall() {
        notifyFlutter(SdkState.WAIT)

        // Callee number is ignored because it is specified in NCCO config
        client.call("IGNORED_NUMBER", NexmoCallHandler.SERVER, object : NexmoRequestListener<NexmoCall> {
            override fun onSuccess(call: NexmoCall?) {
                onGoingCall = call
                notifyFlutter(SdkState.ON_CALL)
            }

            override fun onError(apiError: NexmoApiError) {
                notifyFlutter(SdkState.ERROR)
            }
        })
    }
```

The above method sets the state of the Flutter app to `SdkState.WAIT` and waits for the Client SDK response (error or success). Now we need to add support for both states (`SdkState.ON_CALL` and `SdkState.ERROR`) inside `main.dart` file (Flutter). Update body of the `_updateView` method to show the same as below:

```dart
Widget _updateView() {
    if (_sdkState == SdkState.LOGGED_OUT) {
      return ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () { _loginUser(); },
          child: Text("LOGIN AS ALICE")
      );
    } else if (_sdkState == SdkState.WAIT) {
      return Center(
        child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
      );
    } else if (_sdkState == SdkState.LOGGED_IN) {
      return ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () { _makeCall(); },
          child: Text("MAKE PHONE CALL")
      );
    } else if (_sdkState == SdkState.ON_CALL) {
      return ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () { _endCall(); },
          child: Text("END CALL")
      );
    } else {
      return Center(
        child: Text("ERROR")
      );
    }
  }
```

Each state change will result in UI modification. Before making a call the application needs specific permissions to use the microphone. In the next step, we're going to add the functionality in our project to request these permissions.

### Request Permissions

The application needs to be able to access the microphone, so we have to request Android's `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO` permission (Flutter calls it `Permission.microphone`). 

First, we need to add the [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) package. Open `pubspec.yaml` file and add `permission_handler: ^6.0.1+1` dependency under `sdk: flutter`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  permission_handler: ^6.0.1+1
```

> Indentation matters in `yaml` files, so make sure `permission_handler` is at the same indentation level as the `flutter:` item.

Run the below command in the terminal to download the newly added Flutter package:

```cmd
flutter pub get
```

At the top of the `main.dart` file, you'll need to import the `permission_handler` package as shown in the example below:

```dart
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';
```

To trigger the request for certain permissions, you'll need to add the `requestPermissions()` method within the `_CallWidgetState` class inside the `main.dart` file. So add this new method inside the class:

```dart
Future<void> requestPermissions() async {
    await [ Permission.microphone].request();
  }
```

Finally, we need to add two permissions (`uses-permission` tags) inside `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file, above the `application` tag:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />

<application
...
```

> NOTE: `android.permission.INTERNET` permission is granted implicitly by the Android, so we don't have to request it in Flutter explicitly.

Run the app and click `MAKE PHONE CALL` to start a call. The permissions dialogue will appear and after granting the permissions the call will start.

> Remainder: we defined the phone number earlier in NCCO 

The state of the application will be updated to `SdkState.ON_CALL` and the UI will be updated:

![On call UI](/content/blog/building-an-app-to-phone-call-using-android-and-flutter/oncall.png)

### End the Call

To end the call we need to trigger the method on the native Android application using `platformMethodChannel`. Inside `main.dart` file update body of the `_endCall` method:

```dart
Future<void> _endCall() async {
    try {
      await platformMethodChannel.invokeMethod('endCall');
    } on PlatformException catch (e) {}
  }
```

The above method will communicate with Android so we have to update the code in the `MainActivity` class. Add `endCall` clauses to `when` statement inside the `addFlutterChannelListener` method:

```kotlin
when (call.method) {
                "loginUser" -> {
                    val token = requireNotNull(call.argument<String>("token"))
                    login(token)
                    result.success("")
                }
                "makeCall" -> {
                    makeCall()
                    result.success("")
                }
                "endCall" -> {
                    endCall()
                    result.success("")
                }
                else -> {
                    result.notImplemented()
                }
            }
```

Now in the same file add the `endCall` method:

```kotlin
private fun endCall() {
        onGoingCall?.hangup(object : NexmoRequestListener<NexmoCall> {
            override fun onSuccess(call: NexmoCall?) {
                onGoingCall = null
                notifyFlutter(SdkState.LOGGED_IN)
            }

            override fun onError(apiError: NexmoApiError) {
                notifyFlutter(SdkState.ERROR)
            }
        })
    }
```

The above method sets the state of the Flutter app to `SdkState.WAIT` and waits for the response from the Client SDK, which can be either error or success. Both UI states are already supported in the Flutter application.

You have handled ending the call by pressing `END CALL` button in the Flutter application UI, however, the call can also end outside of the Flutter app e.g. the call will be rejected or answered and later ended by the callee (on the real phone). 

To support these cases we have to add `NexmoCallEventListener` listener to the call instance and listen for call-specific events. 

Define the `callEventListener` property at the top of the `MainActivity` class:

```kotlin
private val callEventListener = object : NexmoCallEventListener {
        override fun onMemberStatusUpdated(callMemberStatus: NexmoCallMemberStatus, callMember: NexmoCallMember) {
            if (callMemberStatus == NexmoCallMemberStatus.COMPLETED || callMemberStatus == NexmoCallMemberStatus.CANCELLED) {
                onGoingCall = null
            }
        }

        override fun onMuteChanged(mediaActionState: NexmoMediaActionState, callMember: NexmoCallMember) {}

        override fun onEarmuffChanged(mediaActionState: NexmoMediaActionState, callMember: NexmoCallMember) {}

        override fun onDTMF(dtmf: String, callMember: NexmoCallMember) {}
    }
```

The `onMemberStatusUpdated` callback informs us the call has ended.

To register the above listener modify `onSuccess` callback inside `makeCall` method: 

```kotlin
onGoingCall = call
onGoingCall?.addCallEventListener(callEventListener)
```

Finally, modify `endCall` method to unregister the `callEventListener` listener inside `onSuccess` callback:

```kotlin
onGoingCall?.removeCallEventListener(callEventListener)
onGoingCall = null
```

Run the app and if you've followed through this tutorial step by step, you'll be able to make a phone call from our mobile application to a physical phone number.
