Hello! My name is Nick Iati and I am excited to be joining the Nexmo Developer Relations team as a technical writer responsible for documenting the Vonage Business Cloud APIs.

I am based in Rochester, NY, where I was born and raised. 

I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Communication from SUNY at Buffalo and went on to work in various roles at Fujifilm. I spent a great deal of my time at Fujfilm working as a technical writer responsible for developing product documentation and training for the Photo Imaging Division’s operations in North and South America, the EU, Oceana, and the Middle East.

I found my work very inspiring and decided to take my education to the next level. In 2012, I  earned a Master’s degree in Professional and Technical Communication from New Jersey Institute of Technology. 

Some time after completing my Master’s program, I decided I wanted to venture into the product management side of the organization. I assumed a role as a systems analyst and, shortly thereafter, was presented with an opportunity to serve as acting product owner for the retail lab software product team with which I worked. 

Eventually, I pursued a product management opportunity with a company called Ellucian. In this role, I was responsible for managing a number of API-centric SaaS solutions designed to help higher education institutions move away from their point-to-point software integrations to a hub-and-spoke integration hosted in the cloud.

During my time at Ellucian, I was also tasked with overseeing the technical documentation and training efforts from a product management perspective. That assignment reignited my passion for developing technical documentation and training and is what ultimately led me to join the team at Vonage.

Aside from my work, I enjoy traveling, reading, entertaining at home, and spending quality time with family and friends.
