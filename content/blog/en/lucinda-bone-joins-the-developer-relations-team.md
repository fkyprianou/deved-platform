Hi everyone, I’m Lucinda. I’m excited to say that this is my first role in a tech company! My background is in events of all shapes and sizes - charity events, corporate events, social events and just about everything in between. My organisation is my superpower - I love everything process driven, time-lined and check-listed, from my work to do list to my family holidays (yes, I’m \*that\* person in the group chat).

This isn’t my first foray into the world of tech though - in my last role I managed a community centred around women in tech, producing both live and editorial content all about helping women secure senior tech roles, find their career path and fight imposter syndrome and unconscious bias. That was where I discovered the world of community management, and my passion for people, and realised it was time to make it official as a full time job! I am thrilled that I now get to do that for such a fantastic organisation, as part of an expert team.

Outside of work I like to keep fit by running and hitting the gym, I’m an avid podcast listener, occasional reader and a dog mum to a bouncy black Labrador called Oggy. I also enjoy my fair share of trash tv - recommendations welcome. I live in Hampshire in the UK, having made the speedy move out of a one bedroom flat in London when the pandemic hit, and after four postponements (thanks Covid) I finally got married in September 2021. 

I’m so excited to immerse myself in this new universe, learn an incredible amount and help to build a thriving developer community!
