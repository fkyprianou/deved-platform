October is just around the cornerâ€”and that means [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is nearly upon us! This year, Vonage is thrilled to be a Hacktoberfest 2020 partner. We're [no strangers to open source](https://youtu.be/zYJpYMCy6PA), with our libraries, code snippets, and demos all on GitHub. We couldn't be more excited to support participants, share our knowledge, and chat about how important open source contributions can be! To fully immerse yourself in the festivities, be sure to check out our [Hacktoberfest page](https://nexmo.dev/2GZcyHc) for details on all that we have planned!

## Wait, What *Is* Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)â€”brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intelâ€”is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide potential contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to projects they like and others they've just discovered.

To take part, Hacktoberfest participants must submit four [quality pull requests](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality) to public GitHub repositories between October 1-31.

Upon completing four pull requests, you will have the option to choose either a Hacktoberfest shirt or the option to donate a tree. If you have made a valid contribution to a Vonage repository, you can **also** receive either a pair of Bamboo Vonage Socks or a $5 [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) Gift Card! Youâ€™ll be able to claim your prize [here](https://airtable.com/shrMXMw6Nwd3Rnjn4).

*FYI: Open source refers to publicly accessible source code. Anyone is free to inspect, modify, or learn from the code. Pull requests are proposed code changes you can submit to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once submitted, a project maintainer will review the changes before they become final.*

### Do I Need To Know How To Code?

No! Hacktoberfest is open to everyone. Whether youâ€™re new to development, a student, or a long-time contributor, you can make positive contributions and help drive open source growth in an ever-growing global community. **All backgrounds and skill levels** are encouraged to complete the challenge.
