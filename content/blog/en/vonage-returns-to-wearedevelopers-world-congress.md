F﻿or the second year in a row we are so excited to return to Berlin for the [WeAreDevelopers World Congress](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress) in July. The team loved the vibrancy and buzz of the event last year, so with over 10,000 of you planning to attend we simply had to come back - and this time we're bringing content. Read on to find out how you can get involved with everything we have going on.

**I﻿t's a Disco - And You're Invited**

What better way to celebrate one of our favourite developer events than throwing a two day party?! This year the Vonage booth is bringing the disco to Berlin, so find us in Hall A at Stand #50 to join in the fun - think disco ball selfies, must have party accessories and general good vibes. Here you can meet the team, find out all about our suite of Communication APIs and even watch them in action at our demo station.

O﻿f course we have the swag too - we're giving away disco branded shirts and much more, as well as offering you the chance to win an electric scooter to take home after the event! Drop by to find out how to enter. 

**V﻿onage Takes to the Stage**

B﻿rand new for 2023, this year we will be delivering fresh content from the Micro Stage opposite our booth in Hall A, with a Vonage takeover starting at 16:30 local time on Thursday 27th July (Day 1). 

Making his WeAreDevelopers debut we have [J﻿im Seconde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/secondej/?originalSubdomain=uk), Senior PHP Developer Advocate at Vonage. O﻿ne part content, one part comedy, this is one session you won't want to miss: Awful APIs: A History Lesson in Painful Industry Mistakes. It will also give you the full low down on our Communications APIs so you can get cracking with your projects. 

Following Jim we welcome [Max Mednikov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxmednikov/?originalSubdomain=uk), Vonage's Software Engineering Director with his session that takes you through how you can develop, test and run a communications application in a serverless cloud. 

W﻿e will then be serving cold drinks from the booth while we wait for the famous WeAreDevs party to start.
